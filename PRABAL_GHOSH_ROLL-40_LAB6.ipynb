<p> dana leigh marks : <p> it 's been a devastating impact to have our immigration courts shut down , amna . <p> you 're well aware of the tremendous backlog . and the only judges who are working are those who are hearing cases of individuals who are held in custody by the immigration officials . all of the non-detained cases in courts , which are the vast majority of our dockets , are on hold for the indefinite future . <p> amna nawaz : <p> and so we know some of these cases can already take years to unfold . what does it mean for the future of those cases ? <p> dana leigh marks : <p> it 's very difficult to make that assessment . <p> i know , for me in san francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 4,000 cases . so many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years , and now i have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them . <p> it could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases . <p> amna nawaz : <p> so we heard about that backlog . that is now at a record high . and if you take a look at those numbers , those have been going up rapidly over the last 10 years . <p> i guess the basic question is , how did we get here ? <p> dana leigh marks : <p> well , it has been a long time in coming through both democratic and republican administrations . <p> while there has been a big focus on immigration enforcement , there has not been sufficient focus to the immigration court system . we 're housed in the department of justice , and , frankly , the department of justice has not advocated either as forcefully or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security 's enforcement resources has grown , what 's happened for the courts is that we have fallen behind and not received proportional increases that we would need to stay current with the cases that come into our system . <p> amna nawaz : <p> judge marks , i have n't to ask you about a issue that came under focus because of the shutdown argument and because of the focus on our southern border . <p> a number of the cases , asylum cases in particular , that originate from our southern border come from three countries , guatemala , el salvador , and honduras . the government has said , the vast majority of those are n't with merit , that , ultimately , these are not granted asylum . <p> and so i guess my question is , if they can find a way to limit the number of cases coming to your court , would n't that help to alleviate the backlog ? <p> dana leigh marks : <p> it 's not quite that simple , amna . <p> it is a very complicated assessment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i describe it as being like a 1,000-piece puzzle , and you have to have every piece visible . <p> so in order to determine whether or not someone is eligible , congress has decided that these people are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge , so that the proper legal analysis can be applied to their case . <p> that 's what our law provides and , frankly , that 's what international treatise that we are signatories of require of us . so it would require a change in the governing law , not just a change in policy , in order to try to make a big impact on those kinds of cases . <p> amna nawaz : <p> judge marks , there is an argument made by the administration that our legal process has built into it loopholes , that people coming who apply for asylum end up staying for years because of the pace and the backlog , and that makes it harder when their cases are ultimately denied to get them out of the country . <p> what do you say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their day in court , and that it should occur in a reasonably prompt amount of time . <p> but the reason that there are delays in our system is simply because we have been underfunded and ignored for so long . the system does work , when it receives the proper funding . and it 's not a loophole . it is the appropriate due process that is what american justice provides to any individual who has their life and liberty at stake before our courts . \n",

permeable pavements to wetlands and artificial ponds -- designed to absorb storm water and even reuse it later . <p> wuhan is one of china 's growing number of \" sponge cities \" that are using

is spent on adaptation activities . however , while a vast effort is required , adaptation offers a good return . the global commission on adaptation suggests that investing us$1.8 trillion in strengthening our infrastructure and other key areas of focus would avoid losses and accrue benefits of us$7.1 trillion -- a four-to-one return . <p> temperatures are climbing at an unprecedented rate , pollution levels are at historic highs and sea levels are on the rise . the c40 , a network of the world 's megacities committed to addressing climate change , calculates that 1.4 billion people will be living in coastal areas by 2050 . at the same time , there are 570 cities , some with populations in excess of 10 million , in areas at risk from rising sea levels . <p> many of those cities '

sustainable revolution is not only needed -- to drive change -- but doing so also holds out the prospect of higher returns for investors . from companies pioneering technologies in flood mitigation to those working on renewable energy projects and innovating in the field of battery storage , there are myriad possibilities . <p> yet only a few of them are eagles -- a term which applies to the winners of the transition to a more sustainable economic model . these companies are forward-looking and realize that adopting intelligent , responsible business practices benefits their bottom-line

nortje is certainly that . he 's impressed so far in his neophyte test career . quick and wholehearted with the ball , and has batted gamely down the order . denly pulls him , there are a couple of men back for that . four off the over . <h> over 35 : eng 81/1 ( denly 21* sibley 35* ) <h> over 34 : eng 79/1 ( denly 20* sibley 34* ) <p> sibley drives rabada handsomely through the off side ! shot

just about . <h> over 33 : eng 74/1 ( denly 20* sibley 29* ) <p> maharaj to denly , starting to see a bit of turn now , maybe the effects of the heavy roller - used twice this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

the ball . england taking no chances . it 's yet another maiden for vern . fine by me . keep the south africans out there , that has to be the policy . england have plenty of time to build this lead .

well enough . <p> kevin pietersen thought it was a bit risky - he tells talksport listeners that denly is always playing maharaj off the front foot , meaning that he can not rotate the strike , so he has to take on the big shot . \" it is a technical flaw . he does not have the ability to rotate the strike so he has to play the release shot . and any slight miscalculation and that is out . there 's only one boundary fielder on - and he is in that area . \" <p> england lead is 104 <p> joe denly is looking to get on the front footcredit : ap photo/halden krog <h> over 22 : eng 53/1 ( @ @ @ @ @

have reached 52 for the loss of just one wicket . for a test side who have made 50/3 very much their signature score over the last couple of years , that is pleasing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibley 18* ) <p> keshav maharaj on for a quick twirl of the arm before lunch . denly 's defence holds firm though and that 's lunch . <p> 60 runs from the session , mainly for england after they knocked off those two south african wickets early courtesy of a certain evergreen james anderson . zak crawley looked promising but he fell for 25 . a learning curve for him . <h> over 16 : 48/1 ( denly 5* sibley 18* ) <p> it 's a bit flat here as we meander to lunch . south africa have been unable to turn the screw after that wicket as england gradually rebuild . the complexities of test cricket and why it is so intriguing . <p> oh that 's a bit of excitement as a shorter one from nortje bounces past the ducking denly 's chin . a couple of singles before sibley confidently finds the gap in the field backward of square to notch up a further four runs . <h> over 15 : 43/1 ( denly 4* sibley 14* ) <p> rabada is done bowling for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretorius for lbw , especially as sibley is rubbing his elbow and replays clearly show the ball hitting his funny bone . <p> sibley responds with a lovely boundary through mid-wicket off a fuller delivery . <h> state of play <h> over 10 : 27/0 ( crawley 25* sibley 2* ) <p> anrich nortje into the attack for south africa , replacing philander . <p> nortje finds a crack straight away , with an edge from crawley flying over the vacant gully for a boundary . that 's more controlled from crawley a few balls later , getting the levers working to crack it out towards forward of square leg . superb fielding from pretorius stops the boundary and keeps it to two runs . <p> a swing and a miss and then a solid drive straight to mid off finishes of the over and brings up drinks . <h> over 8 : 21/0 ( crawley 19* sibley 2* ) <p> philander , into his fourth over , tries to entice crawley into a shot but he is not tempted . the south african drew the opener into an outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> again he shoulders arms and does n't give anything away on the next couple either . philander chucks a few words down to the england batsman after failing to find a crack on the crease . the last delivery is too straight and crawley works it away for a boundary . <h> over 7 : 17/0 ( crawley 15* sibley 2* ) <p> short leg is in for crawley as south africa aim to keep the pressure on the england opener . that would not have been part of the plan though as crawley flicks it fine for a boundary . and then another through backward square leg . a good response from the kent man . <h> over 5 : 12/0 ( crawley 10* sibley 2* ) <p> ouch ! crawley attempts the pull shot but the ball hits his arm and then ricochets right up into his grille . a quick check of the helmet and play continues . <p> rabada giving him some lip , verbally , too as crawley 's feet hardly move on the next couple . he then ducks into another short one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly that opening smooth over from crawley seems a long time ago . <h> over 1 : 8/0 ( crawley 8* sibley 0* ) <p> rabada takes the new ball in hand from the kelvin grove end . thunders in towards crawley who leaves it confidently and then strokes it through the leg-side for four . talk about nerve-settler . and back to sensibly leaving on the next . another confidence-booster for the newbie opener as he drives straight back down the ground for another boundary . <p> eeeek ! all that good work nearly undone as he looks to drive again but is a touch early and the ball squirts under his bat , narrowly missing the stumps . <h> south africa 223 all out ( trail england by 46 runs ) <p> whatever england ate for breakfast clearly did the trick , with south africa dismissed in under half an hour . he may not even have played this test had everyone been fit but james anderson finishes with 5-40 from 19 overs to put england right in the driving seat in this test . <p> every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test with ben stokes the slip-catcher extraordinaire . he becomes the first england fielder to take five catches in a single test innings . <p> disappointment for south africa but with inexperienced england openers and a brand new cherry in hand , there is still hope . game on . <h> over 88 : 222/9 ( philander 16* nortje 4* ) <h> over 87 : 221/9 ( philander 15* nortje 4* ) <p> run out chance ! groans from the england players . they could have had the innings wrapped up there . <p> philander , eager to get the runs , goes for a single that is really not on after slicing to gully . nortje is stranded but pope 's effort fails to hit the wickets . anderson then sends a jaffa down , seaming away off a good length , which nearly catches out nortje . <p> after holding firm off the next two , the tailender then clips down to the boundary to relieve the pressure and blocks the last . <h> over 86 : 216/9 ( philander 14* nortje 0* ) <p> barmy army understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad gets his first action of the day from the wynberg end . <p> pressure on philander certainly now to try and eek out some crucial runs for south africa after that first over . that 's not the way to do it though as he wafts at one outside off and fails to connect . ugly . he does manage to punch one through the off side to leave nortje to face the final delivery which he shoulders arms to . <h> nearly time for play to start <p> vernon philander would love to sign off his newlands swansong on a winning note . he will be called upon with the ball later but first there are matters to attend to with the bat , with the south african 13 not out . the all-rounder is moving to somerset this year . <p> joining him at the crease today though is kagiso rabada . what can the hosts add to their overnight tally ? jimmy anderson warming up for the first over . <h> early cloud cover <p> even with one of the stands under construction , it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much to tick off the bucket list i 'd say . the england fans will be in fine voice again , hopeful of a few early wickets . i 'm told no rain forecast for today , despite the early cloud . <h> good morning <p> and welcome to day three of the second test in cape town . <p> as our cricket correspondent in cape town , scyld berry , wrote at the close of play yesterday , there 's ' life in the old dogs yet ' . he was , of course , referring to england 's top two test wicket-takers james anderson and stuart broad who helped england turn a wicket-less second session into a highly profitable third one to help the tourists forge a path back into the series . together they took five wickets for only 70 runs to give england every chance of yet winning this match - and series . not bad for players who were at the risk of being dropped if a certain jofra archer had been fit . <p> in plain numbers , south africa reached 215-8 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 269 all out . as well as the contributions of veteran fast bowlers anderson and broad , 21-year-old seamer sam curran and 22-year-old spinner dom bess both made important breakthroughs into the south africa attack . it also represented a day to cheer finally for joe root who has seen his captaincy come under serious scrutiny lately during a difficult tour full of illness and injury . \" we reaped the rewards towards the end of the day , \" curran said afterwards . \" no wickets in the middle session but we knew the rewards would come if we stuck at it ... i think all in all a good day . hopefully we can bat big and try and win this game . \" <p> the first task this morning for england , however , will be snaffling those final two wickets , preferably nice and quickly before south africa gain parity . but even if the hosts do nudge ahead , with a pitch starting to show variable bounce and some sideways movement off widening cracks , batting last here will be a tough task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their second innings . although with england 's batting patterns of late , that is always a big if . a match-deciding day ahead .

was he really only talking about european cathedrals ? \" <p> voting with their handshakes : the u.k. may be angling for a doubly special relationship with the u.s. post brexit , but at least two major british figures are publicly defying trump by showing support for his teenage arch nemesis greta thunberg . <p> and the guv : bank of england governor mark carney also backed thunberg in her clash with trump , contrasting her contribution to tackling the climate emergency with the white house 's less helpful approach . read it at the guardian . <p> trump concedes ... that greta has done ( at least ) one thing better than him : \" she beat me out on time magazine , \" he said at his press conference , after being told she was only 17 years old . <h> disconnected davos <p> curious : who 's best placed to speak about the 90-plus-day protests in lebanon ?

's future relationship with the eu , von der leyen said that while \" shared values \" will continue to unite the two , london should remember that \" there is a difference whether you are a member state or not a member state where access to the single market is concerned . \" <p> the money quote : \" if it is the u.k. 's choice to be more distant to the eu , then there will be more distance where the single market is concerned , \" vdl said . mic drop . <p> no justice like tax justice : in his davos speech this morning , spanish pm pedro s ? nchez identified reestablishing social justice as a key challenge for spain and europe . \" we live in prosperous societies which nevertheless have alarming levels of poverty , \" he said , adding that tax avoidance is mentioned too rarely . \" let us not fool ourselves , \" he continued , \" there can not be social justice without tax justice . \" <p> echoing that message : spain 's deputy pm nadia calvi ? o , in an interview with cnbc . <p> green prince : look out for the keynote speech from prince charles this afternoon at 2:40 p.m . the prince of wales is a lifelong environmentalist , a philosophy he has put into practice throughout his duchy of cornwall ( which also happens to fund part of prince harry and meghan markle 's lives , but we do n't expect he will touch on that today ) . <h> that 's awkward <p> growing pains : it 's not every day that one gets to witness an intense exchange between the head honcho of the european commission and their white house counterpart , but that 's the beauty of davos , is n't it ? on tuesday , ursula von der leyen had her first bilateral meeting with trump since becoming commission president -- an important moment for the new , geopolitical european commission . but alas , there were no eu-side journalists there to see it . <p> he said , she said : the white house accused commission staffers of failing to send the names of the journalists they wanted in the room to the u.s. team in advance ; team vdl said they 'd never been asked to do so . but despite the fact wef journalists undergo multiple levels of security screening , the white house would n't budge on its protocol . <h> taxing tech <p> trump huddles with tech execs : donald trump had breakfast today with business leaders and tech executives including apple ceo tim cook , microsoft boss satya nadella and salesforce chief marc benioff . also in attendance : white house adviser and first daughter ivanka trump , director of the national economic council larry kudlow , and the u.s. secretaries of labor , transportation , commerce and treasury . <p> the backdrop : the tech industry has a lot to celebrate after the trump administration reached an agreement with france to pause plans for a digital services tax on u.s. giants including facebook and google , while the two sides and the oecd try to hammer out a longer term deal . ( the deal underscores how the industry continues to rack up major policy victories in washington on trade , taxes and more . bjarke smith-meyer has more on this . ) <p> quotable : \" trade truce is not the same as trade peace -- trade peace is what we should be aiming for , \" said imf chief kristalina georgieva on a panel this morning . <p> what about the brits ? mnuchin was on a panel alongside u.k. chancellor sajid javid this morning . asked about britain 's own planned digital tax , he said : \" we will be having some private conversations ... and i am sure the president trump and boris johnson will be talking on it as well , as the president did with president macron . \" he added ominously : \" we think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature . if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies , we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies . \" <p> the saj unrattled : \" we plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in april , \" javid said , adding that it would be \" proportionate \" and \" temporary , \" and \" it will fall away once there is an international solution . \" <p> in conclusion : \" we all agree that something needs to happen and it should be done in an international way , \" mnuchin said . \" this year could be that year of change . \" <h> more tech ( because in davos you can never have enough ) <p> did mbs hack bezos ?

there were two sessions this morning to mend your tired , burned-out souls . if you had three hours to spare , the first , held atop a nearby mountain , promised to help you \" learn how to add more joy to your life . \" if you were pressed for time , there was a more-manageable 30-minute meditation session led by davos regular sadhguru . playbook could n't get to either because we were getting in place to attend panels on geopolitics and climate policy -- no rest for the wicked . but if you are so inclined , sadhguru is leading another morning meditation session at 8:15 a.m . thursday morning . <p> overheard : \" one of the questions on the entrance test my 10-year-old had to take was whether his father has ? 48,000 for yearly tuition . \" unclear which is more mind boggling , that a 10-year-old 's boarding school should cost this much , or that a 10-year-old should know how much his father makes . playbook did n't ask whether there was a question about the offspring 's mother 's earnings . <p> $34,000 : speaking of expensive offspring , that 's how much vehicles rented by the u.s. secret service to shuttle ivanka trump around davos for two days is costing taxpayers . the total price tag for the entire presidential delegation is over $4 million , according to quartz , twice as expensive as donald trump 's first visit to davos in 2018 . playbook spotted the first daughter walking in the congress hall , and very few vips have elicited a similar commotion . chinese journalists armed with phone-cameras tailed her , while cnn 's jim acosta attempted a question about her father 's impeachment . she remained unflappably mute . <p> oh mama : to be fair to the trumps , davos is a pricey place . playbook , for instance , had a schnitzel at the hotel schatzalp that cost an eye-watering 56 swiss francs ( around ? 52 or $57 ) , with undercooked and over-cucumbered potatoes . we 've had better schnitzel for a quarter of the price in a neighborhood caf ? in vienna . <p> big fashion does davos : it had to happen : the vogue nightcap at davos house was hosted by supermodel ( and philanthropist and angel investor ) natalia vodianova and conde nast publishing director vanessa kingori . the weirdest part ? wesley snipes requested salsa music only during the nightcap . <p> ski report : the last snowfall was sunday and the temperatures are climbing , but playbook ran into some lucky early risers hitting the slopes as we made our way to the conference hall . today expect a high of 6c and sunny skies . <p> **a message from goldman sachs : at goldman sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . the firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . they will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . that 's why goldman sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> welcome back to the davos playbook , arriving a little later than expected today , just like u.s. president donald trump did . <h> driving the day <p> it 's top billing day in davos -- just in case the constant stream of landing helicopters had n't clued you in already . and the special brand of wef schizophrenia continues today : youth climate activists are headlining panels while the world leader who occasionally mocks them gets the opening address . and it 's not the only contradiction of this forum , but more on that further below . <p> what trump had to say : the u.s. president 's long-awaited davos speech ( so long awaited , the wef folks had to rope in some swiss tenors in traditional dress to sing for the grumbling crowd ) was practically a love-letter to his chinese counterpart , xi jinping . \" he 's for china , i 'm for the u.s. , but other than that , we love each other , \" trump said when he took to the stage , 20 minutes behind schedule . ( playbook side note : before you pop your corks , let 's wait for the rest of the u.s.-china trade deal to be hammered out . ) <p> trump 's two davos messages ... <p> 1 . got trade nerves ? get used to it . trump reckons his war-strategy is on the money , describing the deals he 's been making with china , mexico , canada and greenland as \" a new model for the 21st century . \" <p> 2 . chill out on climate change : addressing the greta of it all , trump cheerfully said : \" this is not a time for pessimism , \" adding that \" fear and doubt is not a good process , \" and calling on folks to \" reject the perennial prophets of doom . \" but the u.s. president did indicate he wants to protect nature -- or in his words , \" the majesty of god \" -- his way , by committing to joining the initiative to plant 1 trillion trees . <p> speaking of which : before trump 's speech , teen climate activist greta thunberg kicked the day off with a reality check . \" the climate and the environment are hot topics right now , \" thunberg said on a morning panel , \" but pretty much nothing has been done . \" ( it was such a hot ticket , a woman was overheard listening to the panel livestream while using the ladies ' room , our colleague cristina gonzales writes in to report . ) <p> **a message from goldman sachs : goldman sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is

about ? <h> tech central <p> tax truce ? a european alliance is trying to get trump on board with a joint approach for taxing digital giants . if that fails , europe 's mountain musketeers are seeking to at least settle trump 's current tax spat with france . those efforts appear to be off to a good start , with french president emmanuel macron tweeting late monday that he had an \" excellent discussion \" with trump on the digital tax , and trump echoing that sentiment . <p> after that pleasant exchange , reports of a truce : macron has agreed to postpone france 's tech tax until the end of the year , elisa braun reports for politico 's technology , financial services and trade pros . the wall street journal reports that trump pledged to postpone retaliatory tariffs in return . french finance minister bruno le maire is expected to meet with his u.s. counterpart steve mnuchin in davos on wednesday . stay tuned for more . <p> ai 's not as scary as the bomb : huawei founder ren zhengfei tried to sound reassuring on a panel this morning ominously titled \" technology arms race , \" ( though he asked for trouble by opening with comments about an \" explosion \" in artificial intelligence ) . it was touted by the economist 's zanny minton beddoes as \" one of the hottest tickets in davos \" -- not to mention one of the most controversial . <p> the huawei ceo recalled that when he was a child , \" the biggest fear people had was atom bombs . but if we look at history from a distance , we see enormous benefits from atomic energy and radiation , for example in medicine . today we see fears about artificial intelligence , but we should not exaggerate : ai is not as damaging as atom bombs . \" that did n't convince fellow panelist yuval noah harari , a historian from the hebrew university of jerusalem . \" the problem with ai in comparison with atomic weapons is that the danger is not so obvious , \" he responded . \" everyone knows you ca n't win a nuclear war , but people do think you can win an ai arms race . that 's dangerous . \" <p> politico interview : en route to davos , microsoft president brad smith swung by politico 's office in brussels . he said his company was prepared to help europe control where and how its data is processed , amid intensifying debate over whether data should be stored in the bloc . \" the default is rapidly becoming that european data should stay in europe and be subject to european rules . we will adapt to that , \" said smith . \" the real question is what 's the model for the use of data that will insure that value

not exactly the best way to convince people that sustainable change is at the heart of the discussions . <p> and invitations do n't either : was historian rutger bregman not invited back to the wef this year because he offended the rich and powerful last year ? that 's his take . at the 2019 forum , bregman called out the hypocrisy of tax-minimizing billionaires flying into davos aboard their private jets to decry climate change and inequality . <p> trouvez les femmes : we grilled the wef monday about the slow progress of increasing women 's participation at davos . the forum responded by pledging to double female involvement by 2030 . <p> ' doubts welcome ' : philip morris international is transitioning to \" delivering a smoke-free future . \" if that makes you raise an eyebrow , you

seeking to end homelessness in the snow last night , bunking down in a sleeping bag with some hay bales as a wind barrier against the -- 17-degree-centigrade weather . having enjoyed the davos high life , ryan wanted to experience the rough end of extreme housing , inequality and weather . his takeaway : wind is the real enemy . <p> there 's a permanent risk of being discovered and told to move , and every footfall , car light or sudden movement is liable to wake you . leaving the sleeping camp just before 6 a.m. also presented a whole new side of davos : the supplier class made up of e-car

optimism never seen before when it comes to worldwide economic growth . <p> tough times for democracy and capitalism : according to the edelman trust barometer , 56 percent of respondents to a survey across 28 countries worldwide agreed that \" capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world . \" at tuesday morning 's launch event , former danish pm helle thorning schmidt said

business after that . \" <h> davos insider <p> lunch matters : word to the wise : if you are not staying in one of the ( very few ) hotels do n't have a reservation , your chances of getting a proper

driver will set you back $10,000 for the week , if the amount one large consulting firm has paid up is any indication . corporations are taking over not only shopfronts ( hence the dearth of lunch options ) but whole apartments above them and converting them into meeting and event spaces . some , like facebook , have erected temporary buildings that will disappear the week after davos . <p> **a

playbook . today 's the soft launch ; on tuesday , the serious business starts . catch up on sunday 's preview newsletter here . <h> driving the day <p> in case you have n't noticed -- davos is going green : it 's wall-to-wall sustainability this year ( private jets aside , cough cough ) . you ca n't escape climate exhortations on stage , on billboards , or even at the buffet line . wednesday will be a meat-free day at the wef . <p> slumming it : more photographic evidence that not everyone at davos is living it up in the lap of luxury . playbook is starting to wonder if there is n't some subliminal messaging going on with all these twitter posts . <p> not slaloming it : and even if you 've managed to get some more luxurious digs , there 's no rest up the mountain this year . mondays at past wefs might have included a leisurely day skiing or a late arrival for many participants , since not much happened before the official wef opening on monday evening . this year , agendas started filling up with a round of sunday night welcome drinks , while this afternoon you can find side events on everything from cryptocurrencies to cannabis and ceos . then the monday welcome drinks begin . <p> but davos is not monopolizing summitry today ... <p> british pm boris johnson is busy with the inaugural u.k.-africa investment summit , which will feature more than 20 of africa 's 54 leaders , who are in london today . while that 's more than the african leadership contingent in davos , it 's only around half the number of african leaders who turned up to beijing and moscow in recent months for similar summits . <p> some european politics : european commission president ursula von der leyen will have to ponder a tempting offer : local paper tages-anzeiger reports that during a bilateral meeting today , swiss president simonetta sommaruga will offer additional financial help for the eu 's migration and climate change policies -- in exchange for more favorable conditions when it comes to the eu-switzerland framework agreement , which has been in the works for ages . <p> macron is choosing france and gathering 200 french and foreign ceos , for the third year in a row , in versailles . sunday evening , macron announced ? 4 billion in new investments from companies like msc , coca-cola andastrazeneca . jpmorgan chase announced plans to double its staff in paris in coming years as it relocates some of its services from london after brexit , though the u.k. capital will remain far ahead of paris in terms of headcount . <p> meanwhile , google and alphabet ceo sundar pichai is in brussels today . he will meet with digital and competition chief margrethe vestager and europe 's green deal vice president frans timmermans . <p> davos twofers : these ceo meets have one thing in common : they 're piggybacking on davos , with more and more corporate and government leaders gathering in the fourth week of january . they either use davos as the anchor for a meeting-packed europe trip , or they use it as the hook to get people to their own events -- a kind of two-for-one deal behind the wef 's back . <p> ' make the world cool again ' : if you see flowers and koala bears trekking through the snow en route from landquart to davos , do n't be alarmed ( unless you 're a climate offender ) : climate activists dressed in costumes , holding banners that call for people to \" ignore the donalds and listen to the gretas , \" set off sunday on the three-day , 40-kilometer ( 25 mile ) , frigid hike . <p> and they 've already left some traces along the way : you might see \" no planet b \" in the snow on your way in today , as rte 's will goodbody did . <h> things to ponder <p> have we peaked ? apparently some think we have reached the turning point on a host of the most important characteristics of the post-world war ii western world : globalization and capitalism . and as a result , we will be seeing more corporate responsibility given to stakeholders , with more concrete work to fight climate change and inequality . if it sounds a little familiar , that 's because we 've heard it before , but playbook will keep an open mind throughout this week and look for signs of this momentous change . bloomberg has a rundown of a few other areas in which the world has reportedly peaked . <p> the new power-brokers : most people did n't know what a cso was several years ago ( it 's the chief security officer , for the record ) , but their rapid ascent continues . ask around and you will soon realize they can have more power at their fingertips than ceos , including the ability to shut down a company 's website or operations when under attack , without waiting for the ceo 's approval . stay tuned for more over the coming days . <p> quotable : \" every company is now a tech company , it does n't matter what they sell , \" says brett solomon , head of digital rights ngo access now . <p> why wef is like high school : do n't worry about fitting in , because everyone is as insecure as the next person in davos . the truly important people feel weird because here they are just averagely important . the ceos feel weird because officially they are below the national leaders in the pecking order , and ca n't escape that fact the way they do the other 51 weeks of the year . ministers feel weird because no one recognizes them and they 're often separated from their minders . and everyone else feels like the plain person at fashion week . it 's perverted egalitarianism but it is , well , equalizing . <p> ... and why everyone comes anyway* : david gelles for the new york times writes that the forum has \" become a punchline \" but quotes eurasia group 's ian bremmer , saying \" six days of work at davos is easily six months of work in other places \" because of the intensity of private meetings among powerful people . <p> *bill gates is a notable absentee this year . \" bill 's schedule has shifted and he 's unable to attend davos as planned , \" his foundation said via email . <p> where there 's no smoke , there 's fire : philip morris , straining to pitch itself as more than a tobacco company ( an especially sensitive element in davos , in light of the wef 's ban on tobacco sponsorship ) , will be hosting a \" grand opening \" to rival the wef 's official one , featuring a live performance by nine-time grammy winner sheryl crow tonight at 6 p.m. at promenade 63 . british artist beverley knight will close out the week with a live performance thursday evening . <p> auto-schwab -- airing today : filmmaker marcus vetter followed wef founder klaus schwab for a whole year , and got very much behind the scenes . ard airs the long-form documentary tonight ; here 's a link , and here 's where to find other language versions . <p> succession ? schwab sat down with cnbc for a rather odd , softball interview about his succession plans for wef . spoiler alert : he 's not planning on stepping down any time soon , he jokes about coming to the office with \" more ideas than they can digest , \" and he 's open to his son playing a large role after he 's gone ( olivier schwab is wef 's head of business engagement . ) <p> -- women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year , which is more than three times the size of the global tech industry . <p> -- getting the richest 1 percent to pay just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare , education and health . <p> wef 's inaugural social mobility report : top findings are that increasing social mobility , a key driver of income equality , by 10 percent would boost economic growth by nearly 5 percent over the next decade . the top 10 countries in the global social mobility index are all european , the top 5 all scandinavian , while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are china , the united states , india , japan and germany . report here . <h> swag

sleek pavilion trying to swap coffee for your data this year . facing off against the data giant are the saudis , who are trying to woo your love and tourism interest in exchange for caffeine . tata

warmest gear : the high today will be -- 4c ( it 's a bitter -- 9 as playbook hits your inboxes ) . there was a light snow dusting sunday evening , but ski conditions are good . <p> tunes : if any of this year 's attendees need a little encouragement on their transformational paths , david bowie 's got some words for you . go on , get those changes in place . <p> security ! if you took the train up to davos on sunday , you probably saw groups of swiss military coming in too . do n't be alarmed , one young soldier told playbook , they were just folks returning from their weekends away and deployments to secure the forum for the coming week . <p> tech snafu : wef participants were lining up round the corner for their badges at 11 p.m . sunday night after first the registration center security scanners broke down , and then the computer network was blocked . <p> **a message from goldman sachs : at goldman sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the

that accelerate positive change . that 's why goldman sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> good day and welcome to the 50th edition of the world economic forum -- and another year of politico 's davos playbook , the essential daily guide to life on the world 's most elite mountain . <p> here is the wef center stage program , with notes on which sessions are livestreamed ( 224 will be online ) . <p> this month is also the centenary of the treaty of versailles going into effect , and entirely timely , as great power competition seems to be making a big comeback . will this year 's forum help foster a regrouping of liberal democracies away from trade wars and toward more diplomatic cooperation on issues like iran , proliferation , etc ? ( u.s. president donald trump and eu commission president ursula von der leyen are expected to meet here to talk tariffs . ) and will the fires in australia finally light a fire under the bums of the powers that be to take meaningful climate action ? <p> **a message from goldman sachs : goldman sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . that 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <h> top topic -- climate change <p> get on the green team or go home : or that 's the stated goal at least . wef is going all-in against climate change this year . with australia reeling from catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged a huge chunk of its biodiversity , the theme could not be more relevant . barely an hour will pass without a climate or broader sustainability session in the official program , never mind the extensive unofficial events and billboards that overtake the town . <p> wef is also on its way to becoming climate activist greta thunberg 's amplifier-in-chief . the forum presents her ahead of donald trump and angela merkel in its list of high-profile speakers and reposts her articles , for example , including this davos preview article in the guardian , where thunberg says : \" anything less than immediately ceasing these investments in the fossil fuel industry would be a betrayal of life itself . \" <p> wef 's alignment with thunberg reflects many things , including the increasing concerns of wef employees when it comes to the climate plans of companies and governments that wef brings together year-round . \" heightened impatience \" is how one polite davos veteran staffer described the atmosphere to playbook . will peer pressure from all the discussions help ceos and leaders put their money where their mouths are ? stay tuned . <p> context outside the snow globe : geopolitical crises are never too far in the background , though . there 's a highly anticipated conference on libya underway in berlin as this playbook hits your inboxes . protests over corruption and demanding more self-determination are still raging in lebanon , iraq and iran . and the iran nuclear deal standoff , with the triggering of the dispute resolution mechanism , casts an ever-longer shadow over any discussions about peace and security , even though iran 's minister mohammad javad zarif pulled out of the forum this year . <p> expect a more heated tone in some forum sessions this year : some ceos as well as wef staffers are losing their patience . ibrahim alhusseini , an early tesla and uber investor who now heads investment firm fullcycle , told playbook 's ryan heath that businesses need to be guided by \" ecosystem supremacy . \" his view is that while it 's progress for the u.s. business roundtable to join wef in advocating stakeholder interests alongside shareholder interests , it 's not enough . <p> \" even financial winners have to breathe the air . they 'll have to drink water , \" he said . \" they still live in this closed sphere but there is nowhere else to go . so everything has to be factored in from now on . we have the science , we have the data . we have the proof . technologies are ready . there is more than enough money sloshing around to fix this . there is no excuse to keep kicking the can forward . \" <p> look out for more \" climate heroes \" ( wef 's words ) this week who are n't greta . the teen category includes : fionn ferreira , who 's working to extract microplastics from water ; melati wijsen , who led a ban on plastic bags , straws and styrofoam in bali ; and autumn peltier , the anishinabek nation 's 15-year-old chief water commissioner , in canada . adults include : neel tamhane , who leads a citizen tree-planting drive that 's put 9 billion trees in the ground in 27 cities in south asia , and jane goodall , the primatologist who redefined the relationship between humans and animals <p> half of economy dependent on nature : a new wef analysis examining 163 industry sectors and their supply chains suggests \" $44 trillion of economic value generation -- over half the world 's total gdp -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and , as a result , exposed to risks from nature loss . construction ( $4 trillion ) , agriculture ( $2.5 trillion ) and food and beverages ( $1.4 trillion ) are the three largest industries that depend most on nature . \" <h> guest guide <p> davos a victim of its own success ? with every global conference now looking and feeling like davos ( think halifax security forum , munich security forum , german marshall fund conferences , nato engages , doha forum ) : what is davos anymore ? decision-makers and experts seem to travel around a conference circuit tearing their hair out over populism on big white sofas arranged in semi-circles against blue backdrops . then there are competitors who borrow liberally from the wef format , such as concordia summit . and to top it off : there 's more programming outside the congress center than inside it , putting pressure on the wef business model . the wef 's success is making it a victim of global elite hyperinflation . <p> cherchez les femmes : gender parity has n't reached the davos summit yet . there are 2,800 participants from more than 118 countries , according to the wef , and yet only 24 percent are women . some might say that 's progress ( the wef has been stuck at around 20 percent female participation for many years ) , but still not enough . wef points out that this is more than the 21 percent share of ministerial posts women hold worldwide , and well above the ratio of female ceos globally . <p> the radical new choice : just stay home . more often than not , wef press releases herald a record number of leaders and ceos and ministers heading to davos . this year the numbers are impressive -- but flat : around 280 senior public leaders , including more than 50 national leaders . for corporate denizens of davos , quite a few among playbook 's contacts are skipping this year 's event with a shrug . <p> a more radical choice ? a co-creator of occupy wall street attending . \" rejecting davos is easy when one has not been invited to attend , \" micah white writes . so he 's coming and committing \" reputational suicide \" -- it 's all very dramatic , but in a constructive way . \" what i discovered is that davos is not one thing . there are many davoses at davos . and it is possible to reject one or more sides of the gathering while still finding revolutionary potential in another aspect of it , \" white said . we 'll have to check in with him at the end to see how many of his goals he managed to achieve . <p> who 's not : french president emmanuel macron , ever the disrupter , is still staying away -- but not without having his own mini french davos , called choose france ( cheekily taking advantage of ceos coming to davos to make a stop in paris first and discover all the ways macron says his reforms have improved the investment environment . at least that 's the elys ? e 's pitch ) . macron also heads on tuesday to israel and the palestinian territories . he 'll be attending the 75th commemoration of the liberation of auschwitz . <p> this year boris johnson has gone as far as to ban his ministers from attending -- except for chancellor of the exchequer sajid javid . the u.s. congress delegation will be relatively small , thanks to the democratic primary and impeachment process . <p> eu chief diplomat josep borrell was vocal about his non-attendance : \" in europe , everybody is rushing to davos , but i think it is more important to be here , \" borrell said at the raisina dialogue on global governance in new delhi . ( a good handful of his fellow eu commissioners are actually going to davos . ) <p> it 's a kind of \" back to the future \" exercise , given that klaus schwab -- the founder and executive chairman of the wef -- has always advocated long-term sustainable capitalism ( see his original 1973 davos manifesto ) . and yet , it 's inescapable that in providing a platform for engagement with all manner of ceos and controversial regimes , davos is n't just a place of consensus and dialogue -- it 's also a platform used by those leaders for reputational airbrushing . that leads playbook to ask : is davos one of the reasons we need a new type of capitalism ? <p> ' ceo disease ' : perhaps another incentive for a new type of capitalism might be selfish ? the coterie of the world 's most powerful and wealthiest will be told this week , by dr. marta ra of paracelsus recovery , a leading psychiatric treatment center in london , that the very traits that make exceptional senior executives -- tenacity , resilience , risk-taking -- are also linked to addiction , depression and anxiety . the clinic has identified a 500 percent increase in referrals of ceos in the last seven years , with bipolar disorder becoming increasingly prevalent , according to the telegraph . and the wef is devoting several sessions this year to mental health . after all , the clinics in davos that a century ago treated tuberculosis , as made famous in a certain thomas mann novel , are now treating burnout and depression . <h> davos essentials <p> check your reservation ... if you 're booked at hotel b ? nda : the establishment changed management in november . but the previous one had already sold rooms for wef week , blick newspaper reported . and many of those affected will first find out when trying to check in : \" when we first came to the hotel , the servers were empty , \" the new manager told the paper . \" we could not find out who had already booked and paid for rooms . that 's why we could n't get in touch with the people concerned . \" seems you 're safe and will get a room if you 've made a reservation via the wef 's own service provider . <p> street sleeping in davos : if hotel b ? nda guests find themselves homeless , they wo n't be the only ones sleeping on the streets . despite the below-freezing temperatures ( more like -15 celsius or 0 degrees fahrenheit ) , homeless entrepreneur , an ngo that campaigns to help the homeless use and gain skills to build new lives , will have its activists sleeping out on the streets starting monday . the contrast between the private jets of the wef set and those in their sleeping bags will be stark . playbook 's ryan heath will be joining them , more in tuesday 's playbook . <p> somewhere in between : not everyone stays in hotels when attending davos , or on the street . in fact , many stay in apartments in town or a trek away . and it 's not exactly fancy-ville . behold wef managing director adrian monck 's \" glamorous \" digs . <p> pro tip -- dress code : you 're spending a week on a mountain . besides the obvious need for sensible snow shoes , make sure you wear layers and make at least one other concession to your setting . maybe it 's a sweater , a jacket with a faux-fur-lined hood , or some statement boots . whatever you do , do n't storm around the mountain in a suit alone . it does n't impress anyone : it makes you look like a tone-deaf first-timer . <p> ski report : it 's expected to be sunny and chilly monday . higher up , on the ski slopes , expect a frigid -15 celsius . it snowed all morning sunday , with low visibility at times . the pavements are slushy rather than icy across davos town . <p> stuck in klosters ? if you 're not staying in davos itself , you 're either vvip and paying for privacy , or you booked late or are on a budget . never fear : try the chesa grischuna , an old haunt of hollywood stars and royals . if a 25-minute train ride schedule is n't convenient , the wef shuttle leaves from piz buin and opposite the train station from 6 a.m. each morning , and runs until midnight ( 2.5 hours longer than the trains run ) . <h> activity guide <p> hottest tickets : we 'll keep you up to date each morning , but we 're willing to bet priyanka chopra jonas will have an edge in grabbing attention when she urges leaders to end extreme poverty . if you want to join her tuesday , you can sign up for the \" reimagining the world 's biggest challenges \" lunch ( hosted by global citizen and teneo ) here . <p> the party wars : cloudflare saw the gap left by google giving up on their annual davos party and zoomed right into it last year . they were determined to win the crown of best davos closing party from salesforce ( many say they succeeded ) , and this year they 've co-opted hotel europe 's karaoke piano bar legend barry , and set him up as the social sub-brand of cloudflare haus , at promenade 37 . on thursday night , jason derulo will top the cloudflare party bill . <p> freuds ' davos house will once again be the nightcap venue of choice each night . the pr agency runs sustainable development goals-themed programming until the bubbles and cocktails flow . the question on everyone 's lips : after bringing over five-star sushi chefs from london in 2019 , what will they do to whet appetites this year ?

products . the iphone is no longer a product just for the high-end market , but it can also serve the mid-range segment . <p> as the company sought to capture the mid-range clientele and even the entry-level market , it has been rumored that apple would launch an iphone with a smaller screen size in the first quarter this year . <p> it is said that the new iphone , dubbed iphone se2 , could come with a 4.7-inch screen and the latest a13 processor , and the price could be as low as us$39 . <p> some media outlets reported that apple was aiming to ship 15 million units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged its partners to ship a total of 80 million units of iphones in the first half amid a stronger than expected demand . <p> unfortunately , apple 's ambitious plan could be affected by the outbreak of the new coronavirus in wuhan , the capital of central china 's hubei province . <p> the epicenter of the outbreak is near the iphone manufacturing bases . so far , business activities in the city have ground to a halt and employees have been told not to report back to work until february . <p> contingency plan <p> that could pose a negative impact on the supply of iphones in the near term . however , foxconn , an iphone contract maker , said that the company has a contingency plan to maintain its iphone business . <p> while no details have been provided , it can be assumed that foxconn will make the latest model in india and taiwan , where it also has iphone manufacturing plants . <p> the strong iphone demand led to an increase in the number of active users within apple ecosystem . apple said its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up by over 100 million in the last 12 months . <p> the active installed base is a key indicator of apple users ' stickiness to its ecosystem . such a huge user base serves as a solid foundation for apple to expand its service business , especially its subscription-based services . <p> apple said it had over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services , up 120 million from a year ago . it expects to surpass the 500 million mark during the march quarter . <p> the company has set a new target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of this year , and this means 40 percent of apple installed bases are paying for services . <p> unique service offerings <p> during the reporting period , revenue for services reached us$12.7 billion , up around 18 percent from a year earlier . <p> the company was able to attract users to try its unique service offerings such as payment , news , music and cloud storage . <p> for example , apple pay 's revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment system was accepted in more public transport systems such as trains and buses in london , shenzhen and guangzhou . <p> apple news , on the other hand , attracted over 100 million monthly active users in the united states , australia and canada , and provided a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories . <p> such services did help to lock users to the iphone as it provided some exclusive content for them . <p> the coronavirus may eventually hit hardware sales in china as shops are closed . <p> but apple 's overall growth momentum should not be affected as its users continue to spend more on service subscriptions , and the rising penetration of apple

<p> the first bank of england ( boe ) monetary policy decision of 2020 will be made at their london headquarters on thursday 30 january . this will be the last meeting for mark carney after a stint of over six years guiding the bank 's monetary policy . <h> will we see any change to monetary policy ? <p> the past fortnight has seen huge volatility in the market expectations of a rate cut . coming a month after the uk general election on 12 december , we have seen significant volatility around each economic reading released throughout recent weeks . initial signs of a november and december weakness came via declines in retail sales ( -0.6% ) , monthly gross domestic product ( gdp ) at -0.3% , and industrial production ( -1.2% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was plenty of reasoning behind the flurry of dovish comments that came our way from the likes of carney and monetary policy committee ( mpc ) members michael saunders , silvana tenreyro and gertjan vlieghe . adding those names to the already dovish jonathan haskel , there is a strong chance we will see the mpc cut rates on thursday . <p> however , the past week has seen that dovish message undermined somewhat , with the provisional january purchasing managers index ( pmi ) surveys showing a huge jump in the services sector . if confirmed , that rise would see services grow at the fastest rate in 16 months . this highlights a likely economic recovery that could take shape over the coming months . however , with a coronavirus curveball now raising the possibility of a china-focused shock to the global growth picture , we are seeing expectations of a rate cut increase once again . this takes us back into a position where there is a market majority for a cut , with options markets pricing in a 52% chance that carney will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look out for ? <p> after a long period of stability , the recent election and brexit agreement has helped free up the boe to take action if they see it as being necessary . this is a genuine coin-toss meeting , with the 52% market expectation of a rate cut highlighting that we are almost guaranteed volatility on the day . it is worthwhile noting that at 0.75% , the headline interest rate is unlikely to fall much further beyond the 25 basis-point move that many are calling for . thus , there is a strong chance we will see a ' hawkish cut ' which sees the bank provide commentary that paves the way for a less dovish stance going forward . <p> this meeting also sees the release of the quarterly monetary policy report , or inflation report . this provides forecasts for both growth and inflation , which adds yet another dimension for traders to keep their eye on . given the potential coronavirus implications on growth and energy prices , there is plenty for the committee to consider . not to mention the phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where now for the pound ?

through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market . <p> health experts say one risk is that the disease could become a bigger threat as tens of millions of chinese travel around

government shutdown over funding a southern border wall has largely disabled the system that processes immigration cases . most cases in immigration courts , which are already overburdened , have been delayed indefinitely . judge dana leigh marks , former president of the national association of immigration judges , describes to amna nawaz the shutdown \\'s \" devastating impact . \"  read the full transcript  judy woodruff :  as this partial shutdown grinds on tonight , we get two more looks at its ripple effects .  by all accounts , the nation \\'s immigration courts are overburdened , approximately 800,000 cases being handled by around 400 immigration judges .  now , because of the shutdown , most of those cases are on hold .  amna nawaz takes it from there .  amna nawaz :  in every case before them , immigration judges are the arbiter , deciding if immigrants who appear in their court have legal permission to stay in the u.s. , or if they may have to be deported .  for a closer look at what the shutdown means for the immigration court system , i           a spokeswoman and president emeritus of the national association of immigration judges .  judge marks , thanks for joining me .  let \\'s begin with the shutdown . who \\'s working , who \\'s not , and what \\'s been the effect of cases that are already in the pipeline ?  dana leigh marks :  it \\'s been a devastating impact to have our immigration courts shut down , amna .  you \\'re well aware of the tremendous backlog . and the only judges who are working are those who are hearing cases of individuals who are held in custody by the immigration officials . all of the non-detained cases in courts , which are the vast majority of our dockets , are on hold for the indefinite future .  amna nawaz :  and so we know some of these cases can already take years to unfold . what does it mean for the future of those cases ?  dana leigh marks :  it \\'s very difficult to make that assessment .  i know , for me in san francisco           over 4,000 cases . so many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years , and now i have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them .  it could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases .  amna nawaz :  so we heard about that backlog . that is now at a record high . and if you take a look at those numbers , those have been going up rapidly over the last 10 years .  i guess the basic question is , how did we get here ?  dana leigh marks :  well , it has been a long time in coming through both democratic and republican administrations .  while there has been a big focus on immigration enforcement , there has not been sufficient focus to the immigration court system . we \\'re housed in the department of justice , and , frankly , the department of justice has not advocated either as forcefully or           security \\'s enforcement resources has grown , what \\'s happened for the courts is that we have fallen behind and not received proportional increases that we would need to stay current with the cases that come into our system .  amna nawaz :  judge marks , i have n\\'t to ask you about a issue that came under focus because of the shutdown argument and because of the focus on our southern border .  a number of the cases , asylum cases in particular , that originate from our southern border come from three countries , guatemala , el salvador , and honduras . the government has said , the vast majority of those are n\\'t with merit , that , ultimately , these are not granted asylum .  and so i guess my question is , if they can find a way to limit the number of cases coming to your court , would n\\'t that help to alleviate the backlog ?  dana leigh marks :  it \\'s not quite that simple , amna .  it is a very complicated assessment to           i describe it as being like a 1,000-piece puzzle , and you have to have every piece visible .  so in order to determine whether or not someone is eligible , congress has decided that these people are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge , so that the proper legal analysis can be applied to their case .  that \\'s what our law provides and , frankly , that \\'s what international treatise that we are signatories of require of us . so it would require a change in the governing law , not just a change in policy , in order to try to make a big impact on those kinds of cases .  amna nawaz :  judge marks , there is an argument made by the administration that our legal process has built into it loopholes , that people coming who apply for asylum end up staying for years because of the pace and the backlog , and that makes it harder when their cases are ultimately denied to get them out of the country .  what do you say to           firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their day in court , and that it should occur in a reasonably prompt amount of time .  but the reason that there are delays in our system is simply because we have been underfunded and ignored for so long . the system does work , when it receives the proper funding . and it \\'s not a loophole . it is the appropriate due process that is what american justice provides to any individual who has their life and liberty at stake before our courts . \\n cambodia confirms first case of new coronavirus  patient is a chinese man who came with his family from wuhan . ( bernama pic )  phnom penh : cambodia has confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country , health minister mam bunheng said on monday .  the patient is a chinese man who came with his family from the central chinese city of wuhan to the coastal city of sihanoukville earlier this month , the minister said .  wuhan is the epicentre of the new flu-like virus that has killed 81 people , all in china , and infected more than 2,700 others . more than a dozen countries have reported cases , although most are in china .  mam bunheng said the patient left wuhan on jan 23 and developed a fever on jan 25 .  the patient is now stable , he added .  the minister urged people in cambodia , which has a large population of chinese investors and workers , to be vigilant .  \" people who return from wuhan city , hubei province of the people \\'s republic of china must regularly check their           running nose , ... please hurry to seek medical treatment at public health centres , \" he said . \\n wuhan , the city of life , and the virus  that is the beauty and the beast of globalization and the complex interdependency of countries in it  wuhan , the capital of the central chinese province of hubei and now the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus was my home for four memorable years . it is a fabulous city ! if you had not heard much of it before , that is because it is also a grossly underrated one .  with a population of 11 million , more people than london , and a five-year infrastructure budget of $ 500 billion , it should have made headlines in the international media . but it was often overshadowed by china \\'s world-beating megacities , the likes of beijing , shanghai and shenzhen and guangzhou .  it is also an unappreciated university city , despite being the largest university town in the world . in the last count , there were one million local and foreign students in 50 odd universities there . that would make it a cosmopolitan melting pot . it is also one of the happening places and a genuinely affordable one           yuhan stretches a long way there , where beer is sometimes cheaper than water . you can buy a whole bottle of vodka for rm 200 in a night club , or for a quarter of that price from a corner shop , which has no closing hours .  i was so glued to this fascinating place , that during my four years there , i did not make a return trip home . finally , i completed my phd despite regular morning hangovers and a supervisor who was the least interfering . wuhan is the place to live , not because you can get cocked for cheap , and still pass exams . unlike beijing or shanghai , of which formative years are long behind , history is making right before your eyes in this defacto capital of central china .  wuhan is the future . it is the clear frontrunner of the next wave of china \\'s emerging global cities . if you want to see china \\'s nerve-wracking economic , political and social transformation up and close , and probably from a much laidback ambience           wuhan is history too.wuchang uprising , the rebellion in the wuhan army barracks in october 1911 usurped the xinhai revolution that saw the collapse of china \\'s last imperial dynasty , the qing .  china \\'s short-lived experiment with democracy began soon afterwards , but the new republic reverted to the autocratic reign of yuan shikai who restored monarchy with him as the emperor . at his abdication , china plunged into the warlordism of fratricidal generals and bandits . ( xi jinping , china \\'s president cited chaos in that decade as a testimony to the mismatch of \\' western-style \\' democracy with china \\'s social conditions . )  in the last count , there were one million local and foreign students in 50 odd universities there . that would make it a cosmopolitan melting pot  later for a short while in the 1920s , the nationalist kmt made wuhan the capital . the communists had headquarters in wuchang , until another purge , this time overseen by chiang kai shek , the nationalist military leader who ruled china from 1928 to 1949 . after the            wuhan also had mao \\'s summer house perched in the bank of the east lake . on one fine day in 1966 , the great helmsman swam ( so said the communist press then ) from one bank to the other of yangtze river in a media spectacle full of political theatre .  that was just before he plunged china into the carnage and mayhem of cultural revolution . if wuhan swim is remembered for its symbolism , so is the city .  it is a damn shame that this city full of life and energy is now in lockdown . wuhan has banned private vehicles from the city , taxies are no longer running . that this happened during the lunar new year holidays , the period of the world \\'s largest mammal migration , during when wuhan gets half-vacated as migrant workers go home , makes things extra sordid .  there are around 80 sri lankan students and their families in wuhan . many have however left the city for the new year vacation before the virus hit the city .  the sri           students there . the sri lanka embassy in beijing has submitted an application to land a sri lankan airlines aircraft in wuhan city airport to airlift 32 sri lankan students including their family members , the foreign ministry said in a statement . however , according to chinese sources , beijing is extremely wary of relaxing the lockdown . it is concerned about the threat of the virus breaking through the quarantine zone .  china has placed 18 cities with 56 million people in lockdown . to make matters worse , the mayor of wuhan has told media that an estimated 5 million people have left the city for the lunar new year holiday before the lockdown was announced . chinese authorities have also warned that the virus could spread even before people show symptoms .  80 people have died and more than 2,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland china and 50 cases have been reported in 13 places outside china .  having learnt lessons from the 2003 sars epidemic , during which china was accused of a cover-up , aggravating the scale of the epidemic           of the wuhan coronavirus for further study .  sars lasted for eight months . if history is any guide , it will be long before things get back to normal in wuhan . china \\'s regular brush off with freshly minted viruses is partly due to a crazy chinese , ( actually , an east asian ) fascination with some of the gut-wrenching types of animal products , either as a delicacy or aphrodisiac . african poachers have decimated the wildlife looking for rhino horns and ivory , and west africans are overexploiting the sea bed for sea cucumbers .  sars virus is generally found in bats and is believed to have transmitted to humans from an infected civet cat . wuhan corna virus is reportedly traced to a major fish market in hankou which sold illegal wild animals . china is the world \\'s largest market for illegal wildlife products , and the national law on wildlife trade is flouted openly . the extent of the coronavirus epidemic might compel the chinese authorities to have a second look at the illegal wildlife trade .  the economic           . when sars struck , it was the government that was the big spender in investment-led economic growth . however , wuhan virus has emerged at a time as china itself is going through an economic transition from an export-led economy to one driven by consumption . if the contagion is not controlled soon , public consumption and private investment would take a beating . that would force the government to revert to the usual expensive stimulus to keep the new normal of 6 per cent growth . as much as building an industrial and engineering powerhouse , china \\'s state capitalism is also responsible for creating a massive factory overcapacity and quite a bit of ghost cities . china \\'s policymakers have strived to avoid a repetition of it . economic consequences of an epidemic would test their nerve .  perhaps , the economic impact of coronavirus would hit harder for countries including ours , that depend on chinese investment and tourists than china itself . economic shocks will travel as fast as , and probably further than the virus itself .  that is the beauty and           in it . \\n kiwi taxpayers in china have no one to turn to with new zealand embassy officials having remained on holiday despite the wuhan virus turning new zealanders lives in the province upside

town \\'s chief tax collector and assessor said wednesday .  the october 2019 list -- totaling $4,073,579,493 -- increased by about $46.2 million , or 1.16 percent . assessment and collection director john rainaldi said growth occurred across all three areas of taxation : real estate , motor vehicles and personal property .  advertisement  in the real estate column , the boost in property values totaled about $27.3 million , of which $22 million was due to the end of a tax break for the hospital on haynes street , rainaldi said . the board of directors approved the agreement in 2016 with prospect medical holdings . under the deal , which affected assessments in 2016-18 , prospect paid taxes on 30 percent of the value of hospital real estate . in return , the los angeles-based , for-profit company had to invest $10 million in capital improvements , which it has done , rainaldi said .  the value of motor vehicles rose by about $9.3 million , thanks in           list . also , there were 2,300 model year 2019 and 2020 vehicles on the recent list , rainaldi said .  personal property , which is business-owned property , grew by almost $10 million , continuing a recent trend . the list was down by 50 accounts , including 29 accounts for tax-exempt solar equipment , rainaldi said .  at the same time , however , new accounts with assessments over $300,000 included bj \\'s restaurant , eli lilly , go health urgent care and procare ltc pharmacy , rainaldi said . also , several existing personal property accounts increased significantly , including raymour &amp; flanigan and stop &amp; shop , he said .  the ongoing crumbling concrete foundations problem also affected total assessments because affected residential property owners are eligible for property value reductions . on the 2018 grand list , assessments on 83 properties were reduced a total of $6.1 million . the 2019 list included 156 reduced assessments , a total reduction of $11.75 million , rainaldi said .  the current grand list will be used for budget calculations for fiscal year 2020-21           corresponds to tax bills payable beginning in july . \\n ghana has tightened surveillance at various ports and borders to ensure the disease does not find its way into the country .  medical director of the tema general hospital dr richard anthony says measures are in place to deal with the situation should it arise .  \" influenza surveillance has always been ongoing by the public health department so we have put in structures , emergency response team , nurses , doctors and security men and others . nationally there is a national response team to make sure that any such case will quickly be managed \"  however , associate professor of microbiology at the university of health and allied sciences theophilus adiku is calling for the deployment of rapid test kits and ambulances at the country \\'s entry points to fast track early detection and treatment of the deadly disease . \\n a host \\'s genes likely influence the spread of antibiotic resistance  in the gastrointestinal tract of host animals , bacteria can exchange the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance ( ar ) via small , circular chunks of dna called plasmids . however , the process in this complex environment is n\\'t completely understood , and ar has become a public health menace . every year , according to the cdc , more than 2.8 million people are diagnosed with infections resistant to antibiotic treatment , and 35,000 people die .  \" the human gut has millions of bacteria , \" said microbiologist melha mellata , ph.d. , at iowa state university in ames , iowa . \" if an ar plasmid is introduced into our gut through contaminated food or by another means , it will quickly spread to other gut bacteria , which will generate bacteria resistant to treatments with antibiotics . \" to stop that from happening , she said , researchers need to know what factors trigger or reduce the transfer of plasmids .  this week in msphere , an open-access journal of the american society for microbiology , mellata and her           host organism itself may play an underappreciated role in the sharing of resistance between bacteria , at least in mice . the researchers analyzed how ar-associated plasmids were transferred from one microbe to another in two genetically different groups of mice . both groups started with the same population of gut microbes and were fed the same diet in the same environment .  the researchers found that the plasmids transferred successfully in some mice but not in others , which meant that ar did n\\'t spread in the same way in all groups . that observation led the researchers to run further analyses , which suggested that the microbial transactions could be attributed to genetic factors in the mice themselves , as well as the complexity of the gut microbiota .  \" there is something in the host \\'s genes that can amplify this transfer , \" said mellata , who led the study .  mellata and her colleagues used a strain of salmonella known to harbor large plasmids that make the bacterium resistant to treatment with streptomycin and tetracycline , two common antibiotics . previous studies           to escherichia coli .  but those previous experiments were conducted in bacterial cultures . for the new study , mellata \\'s group studied how the plasmids spread to e. coli in the animals themselves . a better understanding of how resistance spreads requires examining what \\'s going on in the host gastrointestinal tract , she said . \" we need to study this issue through the lens of the host \\'s complex environment , since in reality this is how this phenomenon happens . \"  mellata \\'s research at iowa state focuses on understanding large plasmids -- which may contain many ar-related genes -- and developing vaccines for strains of e. coli that are resistant to antibiotic treatment . previous work by her group showed that mouse strains with a limited set of known gut microbes are more susceptible to infections than conventional mice . that observation led them to investigate how the genetic background of the animal itself -- and not just the microbial community -- might have some influence on the transfer of plasmids .  mellata \\'s group is now following up on the experiment           can trigger the plasmid transfer . she hopes those findings can lead to a new way to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance . \" if we can target those specific host factors , we can reduce the plasmid transfer , which will prevent the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains , \" she said .  \" people are dying from bacterial infections , \" she said . \" they should not be dying from bacteria like e. coli . the emergence of bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics is happening really fast , and we want to discover what \\'s making that happen . \"  citation : a host \\'s genes likely

recently , wuhan was one of many chinese cities where a rapidly expanding concrete and asphalt landscape had created severe flooding risk . in 2016 , torrential rains hit the city , cutting off entire neighborhoods and claiming 14 lives .  today , however , wuhan is undergoing an urban and ecological makeover -- from permeable pavements to wetlands and artificial ponds -- designed to absorb storm water and even reuse it later .  wuhan is one of china \\'s growing number of \" sponge cities \" that are using technology to mitigate the effects of extreme weather caused by global warming . but it is also an illustration of how tackling climate change is creating opportunities for companies to generate shareholder returns while doing good for the planet .  arcadis , a dutch engineering group , is behind the project to rethink and help shape policies in wuhan . suez , another european company , is working in the city of chongqing where its state-of-the-art urban drainage system provides real-time analysis and forecasting of drainage , reuse of water and exposure to flood risk           opportunities in finding ways to decouple economic activity and growth from environmental impact , as part of the sustainable revolution . at present , only five percent of climate change investment is spent on adaptation activities . however , while a vast effort is required , adaptation offers a good return . the global commission on adaptation suggests that investing us$1.8 trillion in strengthening our infrastructure and other key areas of focus would avoid losses and accrue benefits of us$7.1 trillion -- a four-to-one return .  temperatures are climbing at an unprecedented rate , pollution levels are at historic highs and sea levels are on the rise . the c40 , a network of the world \\'s megacities committed to addressing climate change , calculates that 1.4 billion people will be living in coastal areas by 2050 . at the same time , there are 570 cities , some with populations in excess of 10 million , in areas at risk from rising sea levels .  many of those cities \\' natural defenses have been lost due to the use of impervious construction materials , such as concrete           water . some cities are subsiding , due to the destabilizing influence of illegal underground wells and the immense weight of urban infrastructure . jakarta , the indonesian capital , is sinking at a rate of 20-25cm a year .  investment in companies operating in the sustainable revolution is not only needed -- to drive change -- but doing so also holds out the prospect of higher returns for investors . from companies pioneering technologies in flood mitigation to those working on renewable energy projects and innovating in the field of battery storage , there are myriad possibilities .  yet only a few of them are eagles -- a term which applies to the winners of the transition to a more sustainable economic model . these companies are forward-looking and realize that adopting intelligent , responsible business practices benefits their bottom-line and can also bring a positive environmental and social impact .  those without vision are ostriches : organizations that are failing to adapt to the sustainable revolution , either oblivious to the speed and scale of the transition , or simply in denial . perhaps surprisingly           today . a recent estimate suggested that 200 of the world \\'s largest companies already bear us$1 trillion of risk from climate-change impacts -- with much of that impact set to strike within the next five years .  the sustainable revolution is creating structural trends that are already starting to reshape our economies . as the challenges of confronting global warming and finding solutions which can help return the planet to a stable footing become more acute , so many of the companies involved in developing sustainable urban systems will prosper . these will be the winners of the future : the eagles .  bank of japan (

admitted to hospital for eating disorders  there has been a 37% rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders in just two years , new figures show .  nhs digital data for england obtained by the pa news agency shows a rise across all age groups , including for teenage girls with anorexia .  the data shows there were 19,040 admissions for eating disorders among all age groups in 2018/19 , up from 16,558 in 2017/18 and 13,885 in 2016/17 .  the 2018/19 figures include 4,471 admissions for eating disorders in children aged 18 and under , up 8% from 4,158 the year before .  more than half of these most recent admissions in children were for anorexia , at 2,403 admissions , up 12% from 2,147 the year before .  this included 10 cases of anorexia among boys and six among girls aged nine and under .  there were a further 186 admissions for anorexia in girls aged 10 to 12 in 2018/19 , and 27 for boys aged 10 to 12 .  the most common age for hospital           admissions among girls in this age group ( up from 939 the year before ) , and a further 53 cases in boys .  some 1,032 admissions were for girls aged 16 to 18 ( up from 909 the year before ) , while 33 were for boys aged 16 to 18 .  when looking at older ages in 2018/19 , women aged 19 and over accounted for 5,274 admissions for anorexia and 3,542 for bulimia , while men accounted for 327 admissions for anorexia and 381 for bulimia .  emma thomas , chief executive of the charity young minds , said the figures were \" worrying \" .  she added : \" while there have been some improvements in community care for young people with eating disorders in recent years , it can still be difficult for children and young people to get the help they need before they reach crisis point .  \" getting early support for an eating disorder can prevent problems from escalating , meaning young people are more likely to fully recover .  \" the government must make prevention           their mental health , to ensure that they get help as soon as they need it . \"  dr agnes ayton , chairwoman of the faculty of eating disorders psychiatry at the royal college of psychiatrists , said : \" rising hospital admissions for eating disorders are very worrying as they are the deadliest mental health disorders .  \" healthcare professionals need to be better trained at spotting eating disorders as early diagnosis and treatment can reduce hospital admissions and saves lives .  \" patients often face long delays in accessing specialist treatment , so the government must ensure eating disorder services are properly staffed to help bring waiting times down and reduce the need for hospitalisation .  \" the college \\'s latest workforce census found that one in six eating disorders psychiatrist posts are unfilled .  \" the government \\'s ambitious plans to improve services are likely to fail if this shortage is n\\'t addressed . \"  tom quinn , director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity beat , said : \" eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that affect people           there may be more young people being admitted to hospital .  \" we know from our research and listening to the experiences of our supporters that it can often take a long while for early signs of an eating disorder to be spotted , for a referral to be made and for treatment to begin .  \" therefore , while this rise in the number of young people admitted to hospital for treatment could mean that the number of young people with eating disorders is increasing , it could also be due to improvement in the ability of healthcare professionals to identify eating disorders .  \" full recovery from an eating disorder is possible and the sooner someone gets the treatment they need , the more likely they are to make a full and sustained recovery . \"  claire murdoch , national mental health director for the nhs , said : \" waiting times for nhs eating disorder services are better than ever , with nearly 100 new or improved services in the community set up in recent years backed by millions in extra funding .           ramping up services through our long term plan , the dangerous drivers of mental ill health need to be cracked down on by the rest of society . \"  this website and associated newspapers adhere to the independent press standards organisation \\'s editors \\' code of practice . if you have a

father of preventive medicine , dr jeremiah stamler , turns 100  dr stamler ( right ) , who was then director of heart research with the chicago board of health , and lab technician betty humber conducting a glucose test on june 12 , 1967 , at the civic center in chicago . -- tns  dr jeremiah stamler has a little problem at work .  you know the kind : that checklist item that you ca n\\'t quite seem to check , the one part of the big project that you have n\\'t yet nailed down .  you ca n\\'t slam the door shut on the work until you get answers .  he knows the problem is out there , just waiting for him . and frankly , that \\'s just the kind of thing he thrives on .  dr stamler is a professor emeritus and active researcher at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in the united states , who recently turned 100 years old .  he did pioneering research into the causes of heart disease and coined the term \" risk factors \" to describe circumstantial and genetic           while working for chicago \\'s public health department in the 1960s , he developed the heart disease control program , aimed at educating the public and bringing focus to issues the city still grapples with , such as the availability of healthy food in poor neighbourhoods .  he \\'s an early adopter of what \\'s known today as the mediterranean diet and his own best advertisement , a long-living testament to the lifestyle changes he advocates .  currently , he \\'s one of only a tiny handful of scientists over age 90 to have an active us national institutes of health grant for research .  \" we have immense amounts of things we should be grateful to dr stamler for , \" says dr donald lloyd-jones , chair of northwestern \\'s department of preventive medicine , \" because he \\'s improved our health as a nation and a world , but he \\'s also affected our society . \"  he points out that dr stamler , who founded the department of preventive medicine , \" has retained 110% of his mental acuity . he \\'s forgotten           n\\'t think he \\'s forgotten very much . \"  but aside from being an obvious outlier in the **31;527;toolong department , the record of dr stamler \\'s life reveals another core characteristic that clearly fuels him .  he \\'s charming and smart , but he wo n\\'t back down .  not for anything . not for big food companies or basic human intransigence , or even the us congress . not for the toll age takes , not even for time .  dr stamler was born in brooklyn , new york , in 1919 , and grew up in west orange , new jersey , the child of russian immigrants .  from an early age , he was suspicious of mass-market food .  \" the loaf of white bread is anathema , \" he says . \" my father got to this country , saw the white bread and was ready to get back on the boat and go home ! \"  instead , he grew up with hearty rye breads and got an early start eating whole grains .  other healthy           liked butter . i do n\\'t know why . it must \\'ve been something in the blood -- intuitive . \"  after medical school , he did what most of his contemporaries were doing and entered the us army .  near the end of world war ii , he was sent overseas . \" to bermuda , \" he says . \" so i spent a lovely year in bermuda , my wife came with me , and it was very nice . \"  shortly thereafter , the war ended , and like thousands of other gis , he headed home to launch the next phase of his life .  he knew he wanted that life to be in research , and in 1947 , found a place to pursue that work , taking a position at michael reese hospital in bronzeville , chicago , under pioneering cardiology researcher dr louis katz .  \" \\' you never win . when you first discover something , people will say \\' i do n\\'t believe it . \\'  \" then you do more research and verify           but ... \\'  \" then you do more research , verify it further and they \\'ll say , \\' i knew it all the time . \\'  \" and he was right . \"  undeterred , dr stamler and his first wife rose , who trained as a sociologist , but went on to become a major researcher in the fields of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in her own right , moved to chicago in 1947 .  \" they offered me a us$200-a-month fellowship , \" he says . \" in those days , that was a fortune . \"  his research involved examining the effects of cholesterol and other factors suspected as drivers of cardiovascular disease .  \" i was always interested in the heart artery problem . why did human beings with diabetes get more heart artery disease ?  \" not that we \\'re indifferent to the outside , but we feel a first responsibility to locals . \"  the question of the role cheese , as seen in this filepic , plays in heart disease is what currently occupies           accusation  but it was n\\'t steakhouses or even food lobbyists who posed stamler \\'s next challenge .  in 1965 , he was called before the us house un-american activities committee ( huac ) , a congressional committee aimed at ferreting out suspected communist sympathisers in america .  the committee was known for subpoenaing a range of people , from the entertainment industry , academia and other spheres of public life .  \" they had informants who told them who to call , \" says tom sullivan , an attorney who worked on dr stamler \\'s huac case , \" and the people took the fifth amendment ( to the us constitution , invoking a right against self-incrimination ) and that was the end of it .  \" it ruined many lives and employment and wreaked havoc . \"  the consequences for refusing to answer the committee \\'s questions was blacklisting , and in dr stamler \\'s case , sullivan says , \" mayor daley would have fired him immediately . \"  dr stamler chose not to exercise a right against self-incrimination , instead           by challenging its constitutional right to do so .  sullivan and his team filed suit against the committee on behalf of dr stamler and his colleague yolanda hall , who worked as a nutritionist in his department and was also an outspoken activist on issues such as fair housing and civil rights .  the committee found the pair in contempt of the us congress .  \" the clients were facing years in jail for contempt of congress , \" says sullivan , \" and jerry stamler decided he was willing to take that chance , to make this a test case . \"  litigation followed for eight-and-half years , during which dr stamler continued to champion public health , but rarely spoke publicly about the court battle .  in late 1973 , the case settled , with the committee , which had begun to lose steam , backing down and dr stamler \\'s side agreeing to withdraw its complaint .  \" he knows that if you apply firm , steady pressure over time , the data will win the day .  \" if           best science , the truth will out . \"  confronting cheese  in 1972 , dr stamler was appointed as the founding director of the department of community health and preventive medicine at northwestern , where his research continued and he took on the role of mentor to a stream of new cardiologists and researchers .  the work has never let up , though dr stamler has decided where to draw the line in one arena .  \" he sort of stopped advancing in his tech use at fax machines , \" says dr lloyd-jones , \" so when we send him papers to read , we email them to his assistant , they print them out , he takes the hard copy , he marks them up extensively in pen , and he faxes them back . \"  currently , dr stamler \\'s working with a team on metabolomics , the study of products created by the body \\'s metabolic processes .  those faxed notes , dr lloyd-jones says , are sharp as ever .  \" he \\'s really at his core a           what it is giving you , and not over-interpreting it . \"  dr stamler sticks to his guns at home as well .  \" we eat a lot of egg whites in this house , \" he says . \" and i \\'m not saying that to make nice with the egg board .  \" i like hard-boiled egg white with tomato in a good sandwich with whole wheat bread . \"  diet is key to good health , he says , and happiness is important too .  he shares homes in new york , italy and chicago with his second wife , gloria , a childhood friend with whom he reconnected after rose died in 1998 .  though age has robbed him of mobility and he now uses a wheelchair , dr stamler says he has one answer for people who wonder whether he \\'ll retire : \" no . \"  \" if you think about it , \" he says , \" i should have retired about 30 years ago .  \" but i \\'ve kept going , on the           that we have n\\'t touched very well . \"  like , for instance , cheese -- a supposed villain when it comes to heart health .  \" there may be more there than meets the eye , \" says dr stamler . \" it \\'s too early to say .  \" people say \\' why are you still working ? \\' it \\'s intriguing questions like that .  \" what \\'s the bottom line with cheese ? it just keeps you intrigued and going on . \"  for the scientist , at least , cheese has a benefit . maybe even , at this point , a touch of symbiosis .  \" i have n\\'t taken the time to get that clear . it sounds simple , but doing it well is a big job . \" -- chicago tribune/tribune news service  we \\'re sorry , this article is unavailable at the moment . if you wish to read this article ,

polished off the south african tail first thing in the morning to finish with five wickets and leave the hosts 46 in arrears on first innings .  then it was over to the batsmen . england have expressed a desire to play in a tighter way over the last few months and sibley , who scored 85* from 222 balls , batted all day to demonstrate that the message is getting through .  he was well supported by joe denly , who scored a 111-ball 31 , and joe root , who made a more fluent 98-ball 61 .  england lost two wickets late on , those of root and the nightwatchman dom bess , to close on 218-4 .  jimmy anderson  \" really good day . we wanted to be ruthless with the ball and we were . we have           they did .  \" i am so grateful for all the help i have had getting back with my

england lose one just before the new ball , and dom bess is the lucky man who gets to face a few minutes of anrich nortje trying to smack him in the head as he bowls around the wicket . the fast man has a bat pad and a short leg and various slips , but dom plays this skilfully and with some heart , until ...  nortje digs a ball in , bess fences at it and there is a touch of something . paul

133/2 ( sibley 60* root 14* )  the ease with which england are currently occupying the crease is shown in the fact the sky commentators are spending plenty of time currently reflecting on the bowling achievements of a certain james anderson . despite the fact he \\'s had his feet up in the changing room since the early stages of this morning .  over 49 : eng 114/2 ( sibley 44* root 12* )  root

of the over but another four runs to the tally .  tea : england 109/2 ( sibley 44* root 7* ) lead           afternoon \\'s work . 57 runs scored in the 28-over session , for the loss of just joe denly . okay , they have n\\'t exactly ripped the game from south africa \\'s grasp , but it was quietly encouraging in its way : the lead grows to 155 and i do n\\'t think many in the south african dressing room would back their batting to score 280 batting fourth . so england are well on their way to setting up a winning position .  in the broader sense , something of a vindication for england \\'s new test cricket caution policy : they \\'ve seen off the new ball and some dangerous bowlers have been blunted . sibley has faced 130 balls , denly faced 111 . it should all mean , hopefully , that england \\'s shot-makers in the middle order could maybe , for once , face bowlers who have n\\'t got their tails up . we shall see ...  over 47 : eng 109/2 ( sibley 44* root 7* )  maharaj ,

this up as very encouraging session , not just in and of itself but i think in the context of how they are trying to develop the test team .  over 45 : eng 101/2 ( sibley 43* root 0* )  over 44 : eng 101/2 ( sibley 43* root 0* )  denly is angry with himself as he stomps off but he has played a good hand for his team there . in           in tests from hit-and-giggle to digging in , he and the coaching staff are entitled to view that 111-ball stay as something of a proof of concept .  joe denly falls for 31 , his test average . he constantly feels one innings away from a breakthrough . has reached 10 in 20 of his 23 test innings , 20 in 14 of them , 30 in 11 , 50 in 6 , and 100 in 0 . a strike-rate of just under 40 is a factor .  here comes joe root . nortje , who strikes me as a direct

yesterday , bess was really allowed to bowl 27 overs without doing much with the ball . england do n\\'t want to fall into that trap , perhaps - because here comes joe denly ! he \\'s blatted the ball over mid off for four ! there was a man back there in that region but he hit it well enough .  kevin pietersen thought it was a bit risky - he tells talksport listeners that denly is always playing maharaj off the front foot , meaning that he can not rotate the strike , so he has to take on the big shot . \" it is a technical flaw . he does not have the ability to rotate the strike so he has to play the release shot . and any slight miscalculation and that is out . there \\'s only one boundary fielder on - and he is in that area . \"  england lead is 104  joe denly is looking to get on the

confidently finds the gap in the field backward of square to notch up a further four runs .  over 15 : 43/1 ( denly 4* sibley 14* )  rabada is done bowling for now ,           pretorius for lbw , especially as sibley is rubbing his elbow and replays clearly show the ball hitting his funny bone .  sibley responds with a lovely boundary through mid-wicket off a fuller delivery .  state of play  over 10 : 27/0 ( crawley 25* sibley 2* )  anrich nortje into the attack for south africa , replacing philander .  nortje finds a crack straight away , with an edge from crawley flying over the vacant gully for a boundary . that \\'s more controlled from crawley a few balls later , getting the levers working to crack it out towards forward of square leg . superb fielding from pretorius stops the boundary and keeps it to two runs .  a swing and a miss and then a solid drive straight to mid off finishes of the over and brings up drinks .  over 8 : 21/0 ( crawley 19* sibley 2* )  philander , into his fourth over , tries to entice crawley into a shot but he is not tempted . the south african drew the opener into an outside            again he shoulders arms and does n\\'t give anything away on the next couple either . philander chucks a few words down to the england batsman after failing to find a crack on the crease . the last delivery is too straight and crawley works it away for a boundary .  over 7 : 17/0 ( crawley 15* sibley 2* )  short leg is in for crawley as south africa aim to keep the pressure on the england opener . that would not have been part of the plan though as crawley flicks it fine for a boundary . and then another through backward square leg . a good response from the kent man .  over 5 : 12/0 ( crawley 10* sibley 2* )  ouch ! crawley attempts the pull shot but the ball hits his arm and then ricochets right up into his grille . a quick check of the helmet and play continues .  rabada giving him some lip , verbally , too as crawley \\'s feet hardly move on the next couple . he then ducks into another short one           suddenly that opening smooth over from crawley seems a long time ago .  over 1 : 8/0 ( crawley 8* sibley 0* )  rabada takes the new ball in hand from the kelvin grove end . thunders in towards crawley who leaves it confidently and then strokes it through the leg-side for four . talk about nerve-settler . and back to sensibly leaving on the next . another confidence-booster for the newbie opener as he drives straight back down the ground for another boundary .  eeeek ! all that good work nearly undone as he looks to drive again but is a touch early and the ball squirts under his bat , narrowly missing the stumps .  south africa 223 all out ( trail england by 46 runs )  whatever england ate for breakfast clearly did the trick , with south africa dismissed in under half an hour . he may not even have played this test had everyone been fit but james anderson finishes with 5-40 from 19 overs to put england right in the driving seat in this test .  every thing           test with ben stokes the slip-catcher extraordinaire . he becomes the first england fielder to take five catches in a single test innings .  disappointment for south africa but with inexperienced england openers and a brand new cherry in hand , there is still hope . game on .  over 88 : 222/9 ( philander 16* nortje 4* )  over 87 : 221/9 ( philander 15* nortje 4* )  run out chance ! groans from the england players . they could have had the innings wrapped up there .  philander , eager to get the runs , goes for a single that is really not on after slicing to gully . nortje is stranded but pope \\'s effort fails to hit the wickets . anderson then sends a jaffa down , seaming away off a good length , which nearly catches out nortje .  after holding firm off the next two , the tailender then clips down to the boundary to relieve the pressure and blocks the last .  over 86 : 216/9 ( philander 14* nortje 0* )  barmy army understandably           broad gets his first action of the day from the wynberg end .  pressure on philander certainly now to try and eek out some crucial runs for south africa after that first over . that \\'s not the way to do it though as he wafts at one outside off and fails to connect . ugly . he does manage to punch one through the off side to leave nortje to face the final delivery which he shoulders arms to .  nearly time for play to start  vernon philander would love to sign off his newlands swansong on a winning note . he will be called upon with the ball later but first there are matters to attend to with the bat , with the south african 13 not out . the all-rounder is moving to somerset this year .  joining him at the crease today though is kagiso rabada . what can the hosts add to their overnight tally ? jimmy anderson warming up for the first over .  early cloud cover  even with one of the stands under construction , it really           very much to tick off the bucket list i \\'d say . the england fans will be in fine voice again , hopeful of a few early wickets . i \\'m told no rain forecast for today , despite the early cloud .  good morning  and welcome to day three of the second test in cape town .  as our cricket correspondent in cape town , scyld berry , wrote at the close of play yesterday , there \\'s \\' life in the old dogs yet \\' . he was , of course , referring to england \\'s top two test wicket-takers james anderson and stuart broad who helped england turn a wicket-less second session into a highly profitable third one to help the tourists forge a path back into the series . together they took five wickets for only 70 runs to give england every chance of yet winning this match - and series . not bad for players who were at the risk of being dropped if a certain jofra archer had been fit .  in plain numbers , south africa reached 215-8 at           of 269 all out . as well as the contributions of veteran fast bowlers anderson and broad , 21-year-old seamer sam curran and 22-year-old spinner dom bess both made important breakthroughs into the south africa attack . it also represented a day to cheer finally for joe root who has seen his captaincy come under serious scrutiny lately during a difficult tour full of illness and injury . \" we reaped the rewards towards the end of the day , \" curran said afterwards . \" no wickets in the middle session but we knew the rewards would come if we stuck at it ... i think all in all a good day . hopefully we can bat big and try and win this game . \"  the first task this morning for england , however , will be snaffling those final two wickets , preferably nice and quickly before south africa gain parity . but even if the hosts do nudge ahead , with a pitch starting to show variable bounce and some sideways movement off widening cracks , batting last here will be a tough task ,           their second innings . although with england \\'s batting patterns of late , that is always a big if . a match-deciding day ahead . \\n are over-insulated homes causing more heatwave deaths ?  share  as we know , carbon emissions are going to have to be eliminated in the coming decades to prevent us suffering from fire , flood , tempest and plagues of locusts . but in one important respect is the cure actually worse than the disease ? that \\'s the surprising implication of a statement on deaths from last year \\'s heatwave by bob ward , the director of the grantham research institute on climate change at the london school of economics . in response to figures suggesting that there were 892 excess deaths between last june and august , a period which saw the highest temperature ever recorded in britain , he said : \\' tragically , many of these deaths are likely to have been preventable . previous research has shown that many of the people who are killed by heatwave conditions die in their own homes or in care homes that overheat . \\'  but why are homes overheating ? in a rush to build more energy-efficient homes , and to retrofit existing homes with insulation , we are forcing people to live in           more pleasant -- and cut heating bills -- in the winter , but come summer it is creating a hothouse nightmare . in 2015 , emily hill wrote in these pages of her own nightmare living in an \\' eco home \\' in central london .  this was no slum , but a brand new mixed development incorporating everything from plush penthouses to social housing close to the river thames . it was built to the very latest building regulations which are supposed to take account of climate change and the need to slash emissions . indeed , it did cut occupants \\' bills and , presumably , use less fossil fuel than a traditionally-built block . trouble is , for its occupants it was also bringing forward the day when we are told that our cities will become unpleasantly warm . for three months , emily reported , temperatures in her flat hovered between 28 and 32 celsius . residents were becoming dehydrated and had resorted to running **33;91;toolong mobile air conditioning units for 24 hours a day . it is not an isolated case : other social           .  there is no reason why we should n\\'t be able to build homes which are both energy-efficient as well as cool in summer . it means putting up buildings which have good thermal mass -- meaning the walls , floors or both can absorb and release large amounts of heat to smooth out temperature differences between night and day . it means stopping building glass-fronted flats which generate their own miniature greenhouse effect . and it means fitting well-sealed homes with mechanical ventilation systems to ensure a good amount of air exchange with the outside . such ventilation is standard in scandinavian homes but is rarely seen in britain .  but as with so many things where climate change is involved , government and its agencies are being panicked into making quick-fixes . we have subsidised schemes to stuff homes with insulation and to seal windows and doors against drafts , but we do n\\'t have effective regulations to ensure that buildings can be kept cool in hot weather nor that air quality inside buildings remains high . if summer temperatures continue to rise it will turn           the rise in outside temperature . \\n can dr. terry dubrow revive new patient judy \\'s \" zombie \" boobs ?  there \\'s no denying that judy has had a nightmare plastic surgery experience .  on monday \\'s all-newbotched , the mother of four turned to doctors terry dubrow and paul nassif after her mommy makeover abroad turned into a massacre . according to the new patient , she first went to colombia to have \" a tummy tuck , a bbl and a breast augmentation . \"  however , two and a half years after the initial surgery , judy was unhappy with her heavy implants . thus , the now 37-year-old went to the dominican republic to decrease her implant size .  \" it was a terrible experience . i went to the recovery house , i was so sick , \" judy detailed to the doctors . \" i came back to the united states , immediately went to the hospital , \\' cause i was running a fever . \"  yet , judy was facing far more than a fever . not only did judy get wounds on her incisions , but her implant fell out           surgeon \\'s physician assistant .  watch  \" she was hysterical . she \\'s like , \\' i \\'ve never seen this before , \\' \" judy continued .  \" neither have i , \" dr. dubrow responded .  to make matters worse , judy \\'s other implant also fell out the day of her corrective surgery . upon conferring with her doctor in the states , judy learned she \" had contracted two antibiotic resistant bacterias . \"  thus , judy required wound vac therapy and a two week stay in the hospital .  while the procedure killed the bacteria , she was left with mess on her chest . without even looking at her breasts , dr. dubrow knew what went wrong in her second surgery .  \" you know what the problem is ? that second surgeon in the dominican republic cut out the blood supply to the breast tissue , \" heather dubrow \\'s husband explained . \" it slowly started to die and turn into , basically , a zombie breast . \"  in the exam room ,           on her breasts . this complicated matters as it made her natural crease extremely close to her areola .  photos  \" the fact that judy no longer has a lower pole makes it really difficult to conceptually figure out how to make her a normal breast , \" dubrow stated in a confessional .  although judy \\'s breast tissue was not \" friendly \" to implants , dubrow agreed to take on the rhode island resident \\'s case . in order to give judy normal looking breasts , dubrow decided to do the corrective surgery without implants .  e !  \" my first move with judy today is to try to give her a good shape without using implants . if i \\'m unable to get a good shape , then i may have to resort to implants , \" the surgeon told the botched camera . \" but , i really do n\\'t want to . because , if you do n\\'t have breasts implants , you ca n\\'t have a breast implant complication . \"  after working some medical magic , dubrow           \" thanks to dr. dubrow , my scars are gone and now i have two full , perky and implant-free breasts , \" judy gushed post-surgery .  for all of

week it \\'s been . playbook \\'s rym momtaz and ryan heath share their davos takeaways below . but first , what everyone \\'s talking about this morning : u.s. financier george soros \\' bombshells .  driving the day  shots across the bow : \" facebook will work to reelect u.s. president donald trump and trump will protect facebook , \" said soros in prepared remarks at a dinner thursday night . he described trump as \" a conman and the ultimate narcissist ... whose politics are a malignant disease , \" and xi jinping , as a \" dictator . \" greta thunberg got praise . playbook \\'s ryan heath and stephen brown have more .  critical thinking : soros \\' concern for the 2020 u.s. presidential election and the western liberal order are seeing him double down on his philanthropic work : he announced he \\'s investing $1 billion in funding \" critical thinking \" via a new network of colleges in europe , which will expand on his central european university . it is the \" most important project \" of his life , as soros put it .  soros verbatim : the u.s. , china and russia are in the hands of \" actual or would-be dictators , \" soros said . and also : \" it is now easier to influence than to understand events . \"  uk not a rule taker : sajid javid , the only member of boris johnson \\'s cabinet authorized to break the u.k. government ban on sipping \" champagne with billionaires \" in davos , caught up with playbook thursday . drinking coffee rather than bubbly , the chancellor stuck to his guns on a tight year-end schedule for a post-brexit trade deal with the eu , and elaborated on his comments last week that companies should get used to the idea that the u.k. will not align with the eu \\'s single market or customs union . \" we wo n\\'t diverge for its own sake -- but we wo n\\'t be a rule taker , \" javid said .  still at it : still in davos , greta thunberg is leading another one of her regular protests at 11 a.m .  driving next week : forget davos , it \\'s alfalfa time , baby . \" that \\'s an annual black-tie gathering where current and past players in the nation \\'s capital invite corporate titans to join them for a dinner and satirical roasts , \" writes politico \\'s john harris . \" the davos-alfalfa pairing serves as a kind of unofficial launch of what is now a yearlong season of corporate and political networking among a certain set of the world \\'s most influential people . \"  davos takeaways  the rookie take , from a first-timer : via playbook \\'s rym momtaz ...  1 . speaking truth to power is not the brief . between wef chairman klaus schwab \\'s saccharine remarks after trump \\'s speech , and a ceo telling us that greta thunberg was needed in davos to balance out the conversation , playbook got the distinct impression that the wef this year was a gathering of rich white dudes hiding behind a 17-year-old girl holding the u.s. president to account .  2 . continental europe is a bit player . sure , ursula von der leyen drew a big crowd for her inaugural davos appearance as the european commission president , but european parliament chief david sassoli was an also-ran , and german chancellor angela merkel \\'s keynote barely registered in conversations . american and british corporations dominated , but their continental fellows were far less visible . \" it \\'s a cultural difference issue , \" one wef official reckoned .  3 . lack of diversity is a glaring problem . aside from official political delegations , you \\'d be hard-pressed to find a non-western , non-male participant . and initiatives like the female quotient equality lounge , while improving the female presence , also highlight just how outside the nucleus of power ( embodied by the congress center ) they remain .  4 . why are we here again ? sure , the world \\'s big-hitters in one place at the same time is a big deal . but this high school reunion for ceos still feels like a relic from a different time : no audience participation , an exclusionary pecking order , and people networking , yes , but largely in their own circles .  the veteran take , from an 8-timer : here \\'s how ryan heath saw things ...  1 . the global elite has priced in president trump -- they now shrug rather than gasp . most galling for the u.s. president : a 17-year-old is better at driving the day .  2 . the wef channeled nearly every conversation toward climate action and sustainability . that was made easier because going green is now profitable a lot of the time .  3 . the future u.k. king is no mere ribbon-cutter : prince charles had more political impact here than the whole u.k. government -- and also more than former pm theresa may , who did n\\'t let her brutal opinion of davos-goers being \" citizens of nowhere \" stop her from taking their money ( to speak at a private dinner ) .  4 . real debate and real inclusion make for better panels ; fake consensus bores . wef will need to apply that to its official stages if it wants the congress center to get its mojo back in 2021 .  channel the fig leaf : also on the podcast , stephen brown discusses trump and twitter with mary beard , professor of classics at the university of cambridge . she tells stephen she was criticized on twitter for being a token participant in davos . but even \" if you are the fig leaf , \" you can \" fight back , \" she said . \" fig leaves do change things . \" she continued : \" a little bit of cynicism about davos is definitely called for , but being too cynical i think misses the way that institutions are made to change by outsiders . \"  bringing in the hryvnia  the new nanny state : ukraine \\'s president volodymyr zelenskiy pitched investors in davos thursday -- via video -- with an innovative offer : a government nanny of one \\'s own . \" for those who invest more than $100 million , we will conclude a direct investment agreement with the state , based on the english law . these investors will receive a personal tutor -- a nanny -- from the government , speaking five languages and available on a 24/7 basis to take care of all your issues . \"  tax holiday : zelenskiy \\'s second proposal is to \" provide investors who privatize state-owned enterprises worth $10 million or more in the next two years with a five-year tax holiday . \"  a threat or a promise ? \" not investing in ukraine is akin to being george bell who refused to buy google for $1 million in 1999 ! so , do not miss out ukraine , \" zelenskiy concluded . let it rain hryvnia !  it ai n\\'t lookin \\' good  falling short : for all the davos talk on climate change , corporate commitments and social pressure , the rhetoric still fell far short of the action needed , columbia university \\'s jason bordoff tweeted . and he told bloomberg : \" policy is nowhere near the level of rhetoric and ambition -- that was the theme last year , and it \\'s even more so this year . \"  woking up : the question is whether all the do-good pledges and globo-speak are actually just globo-bull . it \\'s not clear that corporations are ready to meet the high expectations they have set among governments and advocates alike , write stephen brown and john harris .  head-desk moment : asked by the male moderator on a panel on gender balance how a governing coalition with five female leaders works , finland \\'s 34-year-old prime minister sanna marin shot back , \" it works like any other government . we do n\\'t need a special meeting room or something . \"  -- which illustratesjust how far the world still is from gender parity . and it \\'s not just a feeling : we \\'re 257 years away , according to a wef prediction . check out politico \\'s women rule podcast here for more .  but but but : areije al shakar , who heads the bahrain al waha fund of funds , sees an upside from the lack of women . she told playbook : \" at least i \\'m here ... sometimes it helps because you stand out , you \\'re able to manoeuver because there are n\\'t as many blue suits . the novelty comes when you \\'re a female that \\'s leading a fund-of-funds -- we \\'re a rarity . \"  sdg trouble : \" the business community is not moving at the speed or scale needed to deliver the sustainable development goals , \" warned lise kingo , ceo and executive director of the u.n . global compact , on thursday . to counter that , u.n . secretary-general ant ? nio guterres launched \" sdg ambition \" in davos , supported by sap and accenture , to help companies and other organizations incorporate sustainability and the sdgs into their business operations and to measure and manage their performance .  **with the odds of a recession in the us rising , geopolitical shifts and trade wars changing the economic landscape and more ,

treasury secretary steve mnuchin , iraqi president barham salih , pakistan prime minister imran khan and singapore prime minister lee hsien loong . but : \" the only one who was articulate was the prime minister of singapore -- the others made lame jokes , like how great it would be for trump to be on the dollar , \" an attendee told playbook .  davos grouch : david blaine was none too pleased to be asked to take a picture of lenny kravitz with a fan at the salesforce lunch thursday .  spotted iii : american \" dancing with the stars \" personality julianne hough having what looked like an exorcism at the equality lounge on wednesday . there \\'s video .  raided : police tried to shut down the cloudflare party featuring jason derulo -- in the middle of his set . david solomon , the ceo

maybe just your shovels ? ) : the 1 trillion trees initiative launches today -- with american support , after u.s. president donald trump announced he \\'s on board on tuesday . the wef initiative is being set up with initial financial support from marc and lynne benioff ( of salesforce ) . but playbook ca n\\'t help but wonder , how effective will the program be , when major banks continue investing in fossil fuels ?  snap ! one tweep shared this description of davos : \" billionaires telling millionaires how the middle class should live . \" ( h/t mariana mazzucato )  get your checkbooks 2 : greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis caught up with playbook ahead of his panel appearance . it \\'s not his first wef , but it \\'s been a while : last time he was here , he was still a venture capitalist . now , he \\'s just after capital . davos \" is an opportunity to engage with the business community , to talk about what i consider a very successful first six months in terms of changing the perception of the country abroad , \" mitsotakis said . \" the economy is growing rapidly ... under the new government , greece is open for business and a very attractive destination for foreign capital to invest . \"  more tech tax talk : after a meeting between french finance minister bruno le maire , u.s. treasury secretary steve mnuchin and oecd secretary-general ? ngel gurr ? a on wednesday , le maire confirmed key elements of a provisional tech tax truce , but said the basis for international talks at the oecd level -- which is the heart of the matter and will determine whether an international or a national tax will have to be levied -- still had to be ironed out . they are meeting again today to do so .  **a message from goldman sachs : goldman sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it \\'s no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company \\'s business . that \\'s why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . learn more about the firm \\'s sustainable finance efforts. **  europe gets defensive : commission president ursula von der leyen told the wef on wednesday that europe needs credible military capabilities . former nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen fully agrees : \" if you do not have a military strength , then people will not listen to you . it is as simple as that , \" he told davos confidential \\'s cristina gonzalez .  cash ai-ght , europe so tight : this afternoon at the techpark davos conference , german artificial intelligence business incubator merantix will announce it has raised ? 25 million to found up to eight new ai startups in berlin over the coming four years , janosch delcker reports for politico technology pros . merantix \\'s co-founder adrian locher told janosch his company had tried to collect investment from private institutional investors in europe such as pension funds , but \" to this day , this proves to be very difficult , particularly when it comes to early-stage investment . \"  he came , he spoke , they shrugged  meh fest : \" two years ago u.s. president donald trump flew here and took the gathering of elites at the world economic forum by storm , \" politico \\'s co-founder john harris , florian eder and ryan heath write this morning . \" every conversation seemed to revolve around the american leader and his signature brand of political disruption . trump came back this year , and was greeted with a shrug . \"  talk of the town ? in his closing press conference on wednesday , trump said everyone around davos was talking about how well the u.s. economy was doing . that \\'s not exactly what playbook has been hearing . one eastern european white-badge-holder asks : \" did i miss something , or did trump not mention the eu in his speech ? was he really only talking about european cathedrals ? \"  voting with their handshakes : the u.k. may be angling for a doubly special relationship with the u.s. post brexit , but at least two major british figures are publicly defying trump by showing support for his teenage arch nemesis greta thunberg .  and the guv : bank of england governor mark carney also backed thunberg in her clash with trump , contrasting her contribution to tackling the climate emergency with the white house \\'s less helpful approach . read it at the guardian .  trump concedes ... that greta has done ( at least ) one thing better than him : \" she beat me out on time magazine , \" he said at his press conference , after being told she was only 17 years old .  disconnected davos  curious : who \\'s best placed to speak about the 90-plus-day protests in lebanon ? must be the politician lebanese protesters loathe the most , caretaker foreign minister gebran bassil , who is on a panel later this afternoon . to protestors , bassil embodies the height of nepotism and corruption in an already crowded field of lebanese politicians .  remember me ? bassil is the guy who bragged at last year \\'s wef about giving lessons to the u.s. and u.k. about \" running a country without a budget . \" playbook wonders where exactly bassil was running his country into ...  come again ? big davos day for brazil wednesday , with economy minister paulo guedes vaunting its \" stable democracy \" and \" complete environment of good opportunities to investors around the world , \" as the eu ambassador to brasilia put it . he can count on one big supporter , at least : the u.s.  reality check : how does brazilian president jair bolsonaro \\'s flouting of his climate commitments on the amazon jive with all the talk about climate action and sustainability we have been hearing from the wef and ceos all week ?  come again 2 ? at times laughing and smiling , the beijing-backed chief executive of hong kong carrie lam said on wednesday that she had to stay on as leader to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus , which has killed 17 people in mainland china . reuters has the write-up .  oh what a night  if you decided to stay in on wednesday , you really missed out . fear not , playbook \\'s spies fanned out across town and the night delivered some pretty ... uncensored ... moments .  resistance : a drunk and obstinate party-goer at the ft/cnbc bash was seen being physically ejected from the venue . but he so adamantly wanted to stay , he put his feet up against the closed door .  top drawcard:jane goodall wins the rockstar cach ? award , and we have a feeling she will be hard to dethrone . playbook spotted many white-badge-holders lining up for selfies at the hard rock hotel , where goodall was wednesday .  spotted 1 : google and alphabet ceo sundar pichai at davos house until 1:30 a.m. -- we hope he did n\\'t have an early breakfast meeting !  angling for that damehood : theresa may told her audience at a pwc dinner wednesday night that the most interesting person she met as british prime minister was the queen . one british davos-goer exclaimed to playbook : \" she is so vanilla ! \"  salt on sore wounds : apparently it is n\\'t enough to wrangle apple chief tim ( or timothy , as his badge reads ) cook for a selfie on the promenade -- someone actually asked him for one and whipped out their samsung galaxy phone to take it .  overheard 1 : at the journal house from one proud white badge to another : \" i \\'ve already slept with half of my consultants . time to go home . \"  overheard 2 : a brit surveying the scene at a party : \" wow , it \\'s like

emerging threat of coronavirus in china and around the world .  inside davos  shuttle diplomacy : the wef shuttle buses are a great way of getting to know people , as we \\'ve previously pointed out . the forced proximity in crawling peak-hour traffic has produced some fascinating chance encounters this week , improving our familiarity with subjects ranging from ai to street art and indian politics

sidewalks of davos in order to get past them -- which has happened twice in two days for playbook . and to those crowding others at security lines , pretending not to see them -- twice in one day for playbook as well . these people clearly did n\\'t get the memo that at davos , everyone with a badge is supposed to be equal . ( of course , no badge , no care . )  the price is right : if you want to create your own lounge space in the belvedere hotel , you can expect to pay $3 million and up for the week . the bare minimum for a promenade shopfront is $150,000 , excluding the cost of any renovations .  by the numbers : one belvedere hotel corporate occupant said they \\'d experienced a 20-percent drop in attendance at their events in 2020 . that \\'s the good news : fewer hangers-on via the hotel badge system means our source is happier with the quality of their guest list .  what you ( may have ) missed  peek inside the mind of jamie dimon , the world \\'s most powerful banker , who told folks at the equality lounge wednesday evening : \" my mom was a women \\'s libber \" ... \" more than half of my direct reports are women \" ... \" leaders should say \\' hi \\' to everyone at the table . \"  the mooch : \" i am 100 percent traumatized \" by being fired from the white house , anthony scaramucci admitted to playbook \\'s own rym momtaz during a panel she was moderating wednesday afternoon .  spotted : the mooch getting raked over the coals by wef security for having so many hair products in his bag as he went through screening .  your tired bones : palantir is n\\'t satisfied with amazing free coffee -- it also had a masseuse at its wednesday cocktail session . best way to soothe that ski soreness .  do n\\'t miss today  side event : blockchain conference at the intercontinental , called cv summit .  mind and body : the consciousness retreat at 2:30 p.m. , which promises to arm you with nothing less than \" the right tools to fix personal , professional or planetary challenges . \"  hot tickets:lenny kravitz at salesforce ... jason derulo at cloudflare ... yo-yo ma at an lgbtq dinner by glaad and the ariadne getty foundation ... there \\'s also the mysterious prospect of a lady gaga appearance at an undisclosed party .  ski report : the subzero chill overnight is helping maintain the powder on the slopes despite the sunshine and warmer temps during the day . high of 6c today .  **a message from goldman sachs : over the next 10 years , goldman sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . because , at goldman sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company \\'s business . as part of this push , goldman sachs is committed to helping clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets -- making sustainable finance a firmwide mandate , to achieve an inclusive , low-carbon economy . learn more about goldman sachs \\' newly announced sustainable finance goal. **  it \\'s day 4 of politico \\'s davos playbook . european leaders get prime billing today . if you \\'re a meat lover , you may want to pack your ham sandwich ( more on that a bit further down ) .  driving the day  more trump : the u.s. president is holding a press conference . watch here .  vdl takes the stage : european commission president ursula von der leyen had her big davos moment this morning , and she used it to send the message that the \" geopolitical \" focus for her new eu commission means a new emphasis on hard power . \" europe needs credible military capabilities and we have set up the building blocks of a european defense mechanism -- it is complementary to nato and it is different , \" she said .  playbook reality check : it \\'s unclear how von der leyen plans on bringing her home country along for the nato/defense ride : germany ( where she was defense minister ! ) constantly refuses to flex its muscle .  stepping up : \" to be more assertive in the world , we know we must step up in some fields , \" von der leyen said . she acknowledged the eu had at times been caught flat-footed in responding to geo-political conflicts -- and conceded that eu countries have at times been too divided on foreign policy , particularly on the conflict in libya . \" libya shows the cost of division and hesitation , \" she said , calling last weekend \\'s ceasefire talks in berlin \" an important step in the right direction , \" and saying the \" commission will strongly support reconciliation and reconstruction . \"  quotable : \" it takes very little power to break a fragile balance , but the true power lies in putting the pieces back together again , \" the commission president said .  message to brexit britain : von der leyen also used the opportunity to send a pointed message to the u.k. government of boris johnson , who instructed his ministers ( with the exception of chancellor sajid javid ) to skip davos : on the coming negotiations on the political declaration which will define the u.k. \\'s future relationship with the eu , von der leyen said that while \" shared values \" will continue to unite the two , london should remember that \" there is a difference whether you are a member state or not a member state where access to the single market is concerned . \"  the money quote : \" if it is the u.k. \\'s choice to be more distant to the eu , then there will be more distance where the single market is concerned , \" vdl said . mic drop .  no justice like tax justice : in his davos speech this morning , spanish pm pedro s ? nchez identified reestablishing social justice as a key challenge for spain and europe . \" we live in prosperous societies which nevertheless have alarming levels of poverty , \" he said , adding that tax avoidance is mentioned too rarely . \" let us not fool ourselves , \" he continued , \" there can not be social justice without tax justice . \"  echoing that message : spain \\'s deputy pm nadia calvi ? o , in an interview with cnbc .  green prince : look out for the keynote speech from prince charles this afternoon at 2:40 p.m . the prince of wales is a lifelong environmentalist , a philosophy he has put into practice throughout his duchy of cornwall ( which also happens to fund part of prince harry and meghan markle \\'s lives , but we do n\\'t expect he will touch on that today ) .  that \\'s awkward  growing pains : it \\'s not every day that one gets to witness an intense exchange between the head honcho of the european commission and their white house counterpart , but that \\'s the beauty of davos , is n\\'t it ? on tuesday , ursula von der leyen had her first bilateral meeting with trump since becoming commission president -- an important moment for the new , geopolitical european commission . but alas , there were no eu-side journalists there to see it .  he said , she said : the white house accused commission staffers of failing to send the names of the journalists they wanted in the room to the u.s. team in advance ; team vdl said they \\'d never been asked to do so . but despite the fact wef journalists undergo multiple levels of security screening , the white house would n\\'t budge on its protocol .  taxing tech  trump huddles with tech execs : donald trump had breakfast today with business leaders and tech executives including apple ceo tim cook , microsoft boss satya nadella and salesforce chief marc benioff . also in attendance : white house adviser and first daughter ivanka trump , director of the national economic council larry kudlow , and the u.s. secretaries of labor , transportation , commerce and treasury .  the backdrop : the tech industry has a lot to celebrate after the trump administration reached an agreement with france to pause plans for a digital services tax on u.s. giants including facebook and google , while the two sides and the oecd try to hammer out a longer term deal . ( the deal underscores how the industry continues to rack up major policy victories in washington on trade , taxes and more . bjarke smith-meyer has more on this . )  quotable : \" trade truce is not the same as trade peace -- trade peace is what we should be aiming for , \" said imf chief kristalina georgieva on a panel this morning .  what about the brits ? mnuchin was on a panel alongside u.k. chancellor sajid javid this morning . asked about britain \\'s own planned digital tax , he said : \" we will be having some private conversations ... and i am sure the president trump and boris johnson will be talking on it as well , as the president did with president macron . \" he added ominously : \" we think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature . if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies , we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies . \"  the saj unrattled : \" we plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in april , \" javid said , adding that it would be \" proportionate \" and \" temporary , \" and \" it will fall away once there is an international solution . \"  in conclusion : \" we all agree that something needs to happen and it should be done in an international way , \" mnuchin said . \" this year could be that year of change . \"  more tech ( because in davos you can never have enough )  did mbs hack bezos ? a bombshell revelation overnight from the guardian , and it \\'s a davos trifecta : saudi arabia ( which will host the g20 this year and is out in force in davos ) , big tech and a billionaire . \" the amazon billionaire jeff bezos had his mobile phone \\' hacked \\' in 2018 after receiving a whatsapp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of saudi arabia , \" according to the guardian . \" the encrypted message from the number used by mohammed bin salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world \\'s richest man , according to the results of a digital forensic analysis ... large amounts of data were exfiltrated from bezos \\' phone within hours . \" yikes . perhaps a good conversation-starter over at the saudi caf ? ?  5g dinner : playbook \\'s ryan heath hosted a 5g-themed dinner tuesday night ( under chatham house rules ) , which generated passionate views on the way forward for the transformative technology . there \\'s lots of work ahead to beat a possible urban/rural divide , and to communicate that 5g is likely to be about much more than faster networks , but a way to connect all things , with big security and privacy implications . people want 5g networks built by domestic or allied manufacturers -- a way forward on their trust concerns could be the virtualization of some parts of these networks . a politico-qualcomm survey across 12 markets will be published in the coming days .  protocol preview : protocol , a new media company that will exclusively cover tech from politico publisher robert allbritton , is hosting a pre-launch vip breakfast on thursday at nasdaq \\'s space . the event features protocol editor-at-large david pierce , who \\'ll be chatting with analyst benedict evans on his tech predictions for 2020 . registrations are closed and the guest list is packed with tech execs , so get there early to get a good seat .  widening the scope  ministry of truth updates : wef has launched a davos friends of africa growth platform . the founding members are the presidents of botswana and ghana and the chairman of anglogold ashanti . the platform \\'s goal is to create 1 million jobs .  on lgbti rights : \" i \\'m the prime minister and i \\'m also gay , \" luxembourg prime minister xavier bettel told playbook . \" i think if people are here , they are here because of their profession -- it \\'s not the gay prime minister who is going to meet with the gay ceo of apple , but tim cook is going to meet xavier bettel , and both are gay . and that \\'s cool . \" for more sign up to our davos confidential podcast .  listen to the big d : there is much talk about diversity , and how to make the corporate world more inclusive . ceo of solvay ilham kadri shared her vision with playbook via this morning \\'s davos confidential podcast : \" diversity for us is not only gender , it \\'s nationalities , it \\'s ethnicity , background , orientation , it \\'s diversity of thoughts , it \\'s the big d and when you have it in the room , you need to listen to it . \"  fighting the man ?  battle for . org : some of the world \\'s biggest ngos gathered at 11:45 a.m. this morning at the wef congress center to protest the proposed sale of the top-level . org domain to a private equity firm . they say the non-commercial part of the internet -- the digital home of ngos , nonprofits and civil society -- must remain in the hands of a nonprofit . internet society owns . org and wants to sell it to create a billion-dollar endowment for itself and its mission to protect the open internet . global internet governance body icann is mulling whether to intervene to stop the sale .  overheard : a playbooker hears there may have been a burning man party in davos last night . we \\'re confused -- is n\\'t burning man supposed to be anti-the man , and is n\\'t davos as the man as can be ? if you were there , get in touch -- we promise not to out you .  davos insider  veggie day : it \\'s vegetarian and **27;250;toolong menu day in the congress hall today -- for those who have been quick and lucky enough to identify both when and where the elusive food gets served . it \\'s part of the wef \\'s sustainability push . ninety percent of the food served during the forum is seasonal .  forget what she said : playbook can confirm that theresa may will be joining the \" citizens of nowhere \" ( as she famously described globalists ) in davos this week , and has been booked ( for goodness knows how much cash ) to speak at a dinner pwc is hosting tonight for business people and their clients . \" the earnings will be declared in the normal way , \" a may aide said . as politico london playbook \\'s jack blanchard points out , the former british pm did always enjoy a good mountain walk .  peak davos : who said davos was just about lining one \\'s pockets -- or growing one \\'s rolodex to line one \\'s pockets ? there were two sessions this morning to mend your tired , burned-out souls . if you had three hours to spare , the first , held atop a nearby mountain , promised to help you \" learn how to add more joy to your life . \" if you were pressed for time , there was a more-manageable 30-minute meditation session led by davos regular sadhguru . playbook could n\\'t get to either because we were getting in place to attend panels on geopolitics and climate policy -- no rest for the wicked . but if you are so inclined , sadhguru is leading another morning meditation session at 8:15 a.m . thursday morning .  overheard : \" one of the questions on the entrance test my 10-year-old had to take was whether his father has ? 48,000 for yearly tuition . \" unclear which is more mind boggling , that a 10-year-old \\'s boarding school should cost this much , or that a 10-year-old should know how much his father makes . playbook did n\\'t ask whether there was a question about the offspring \\'s mother \\'s earnings .  $34,000 : speaking of expensive offspring , that \\'s how much vehicles rented by the u.s. secret service to shuttle ivanka trump around davos for two days is costing taxpayers . the total price tag for the entire presidential delegation is over $4 million , according to quartz , twice as expensive as donald trump \\'s first visit to davos in 2018 . playbook spotted the first daughter walking in the congress hall , and very few vips have elicited a similar commotion . chinese journalists armed with phone-cameras tailed her , while cnn \\'s jim acosta attempted a question about her father \\'s impeachment . she remained unflappably mute .  oh mama : to be fair to the trumps , davos is a pricey place . playbook , for instance , had a schnitzel at the hotel schatzalp that cost an eye-watering 56 swiss francs ( around ? 52 or $57 ) , with undercooked and over-cucumbered potatoes . we \\'ve had better schnitzel for a quarter of the price in a neighborhood caf ? in vienna .  big fashion does davos : it had to happen : the vogue nightcap at davos house was hosted by supermodel ( and philanthropist and angel investor ) natalia vodianova and conde nast publishing director vanessa kingori . the weirdest part ? wesley snipes requested salsa music only during the nightcap .  ski report : the last snowfall was sunday and the temperatures are climbing , but playbook ran into some lucky early risers hitting the slopes as we made our way to the conference hall . today expect a high of 6c and sunny skies .  **a message from goldman sachs : at goldman sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . the firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . they will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . that \\'s why goldman sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . explore the firm \\'s newly announced sustainable finance goal. **  welcome back to the davos playbook , arriving a little later than expected today , just like u.s. president donald trump did .  driving the day  it \\'s top billing day in davos -- just in case the constant stream of landing helicopters had n\\'t clued you in already . and the special brand of wef schizophrenia continues today : youth climate activists are headlining panels while the world leader who occasionally mocks them gets the opening address . and it \\'s not the only contradiction of this forum , but more on that further below .  what trump had to say : the u.s. president \\'s long-awaited davos speech ( so long awaited , the wef folks had to rope in some swiss tenors in traditional dress to sing for the grumbling crowd ) was practically a love-letter to his chinese counterpart , xi jinping . \" he \\'s for china , i \\'m for the u.s. , but other than that , we love each other , \" trump said when he took to the stage , 20 minutes behind schedule . ( playbook side note : before you pop your corks , let \\'s wait for the rest of the u.s.-china trade deal to be hammered out . )  trump \\'s two davos messages ...  1 . got trade nerves ? get used to it . trump reckons his war-strategy is on the money , describing the deals he \\'s been making with china , mexico , canada and greenland as \" a new model for the 21st century . \"  2 . chill out on climate change : addressing the greta of it all , trump cheerfully said : \" this is not a time for pessimism , \" adding that \" fear and doubt is not a good process , \" and calling on folks to \" reject the perennial prophets of doom . \" but the u.s. president did indicate he wants to protect nature -- or in his words , \" the majesty of god \" -- his way , by committing to joining the initiative to plant 1 trillion trees .  speaking of which : before trump \\'s speech , teen climate activist greta thunberg kicked the day off with a reality check . \" the climate and the environment are hot topics right now , \" thunberg said on a morning panel , \" but pretty much nothing has been done . \" ( it was such a hot ticket , a woman was overheard listening to the panel livestream while using the ladies \\' room , our colleague cristina gonzales writes in to report . )  **a message from goldman sachs : goldman sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it \\'s no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company \\'s business . that \\'s why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . learn more about the firm \\'s sustainable finance efforts. **  trump will be in town until wednesday , and has a series of bilateral meetings scheduled , including with european commission president ursula von der leyen this afternoon . also in that meeting : european trade commissioner phil hogan and internal market commissioner thierry breton . what could they possibly all be talking about ?  tech central  tax truce ? a european alliance is trying to get trump on board with a joint approach for taxing digital giants . if that fails , europe \\'s mountain musketeers are seeking to at least settle trump \\'s current tax spat with france . those efforts appear to be off to a good start , with french president emmanuel macron tweeting late monday that he had an \" excellent discussion \" with trump on the digital tax , and trump echoing that sentiment .  after that pleasant exchange , reports of a truce : macron has agreed to postpone france \\'s tech tax until the end of the year , elisa braun reports for politico \\'s technology , financial services and trade pros . the wall street journal reports that trump pledged to postpone retaliatory tariffs in return . french finance minister bruno le maire is expected to meet with his u.s. counterpart steve mnuchin in davos on wednesday . stay tuned for more .  ai \\'s not as scary as the bomb : huawei founder ren zhengfei tried to sound reassuring on a panel this morning ominously titled \" technology arms race , \" ( though he asked for trouble by opening with comments about an \" explosion \" in artificial intelligence ) . it was touted by the economist \\'s zanny minton beddoes as \" one of the hottest tickets in davos \" -- not to mention one of the most controversial .  the huawei ceo recalled that when he was a child , \" the biggest fear people had was atom bombs . but if we look at history from a distance , we see enormous benefits from atomic energy and radiation , for example in medicine . today we see fears about artificial intelligence , but we should not exaggerate : ai is not as damaging as atom bombs . \" that did n\\'t convince fellow panelist yuval noah harari , a historian from the hebrew university of jerusalem . \" the problem with ai in comparison with atomic weapons is that the danger is not so obvious , \" he responded . \" everyone knows you ca n\\'t win a nuclear war , but people do think you can win an ai arms race . that \\'s dangerous . \"  politico interview : en route to davos , microsoft president brad smith swung by politico \\'s office in brussels . he said his company was prepared to help europe control where and how its data is processed , amid intensifying debate over whether data should be stored in the bloc . \" the default is rapidly becoming that european data should stay in europe and be subject to european rules . we will adapt to that , \" said smith . \" the real question is what \\'s the model for the use of data that will insure that value of the data accrues to these countries . \"  walking the walk ... kinda  geography does n\\'t lie : climate and sustainability may be the talk of the town , but playbook took a stroll along the promenade and spotted the sdg tent quite a hike away -- an afterthought ? -- from the center of the action , where companies like google , facebook and philip morris international have set up shop . not exactly the best way to convince people that sustainable change is at the heart of the discussions .  and invitations do n\\'t either : was historian rutger bregman not invited back to the wef this year because he offended the rich and powerful last year ? that \\'s his take . at the 2019 forum , bregman called out the hypocrisy of tax-minimizing billionaires flying into davos aboard their private jets to decry climate change and inequality .  trouvez les femmes : we grilled the wef monday about the slow progress of increasing women \\'s participation at davos . the forum responded by pledging to double female involvement by 2030 .  \\' doubts welcome \\' : philip morris international is transitioning to \" delivering a smoke-free future . \" if that makes you raise an eyebrow , you are not the only one . the cigarette titan has a pop-up shop on the promenade where it \\'s pushing its \" unsmoked \" concept and inviting doubters to come inside and debate . overheard at its party last night ( where attendees were serenaded by sheryl crow ) : \" nicotine is n\\'t the problem , burning it is . \"  sleeping in the snow -- davos style : playbook \\'s ryan heath joined campaigners seeking to end homelessness in the snow last night , bunking down in a sleeping bag with some hay bales as a wind barrier against the -- 17-degree-centigrade weather . having enjoyed the davos high life , ryan wanted to experience the rough end of extreme housing , inequality and weather . his takeaway : wind is the real enemy .  there \\'s a permanent risk of being discovered and told to move , and every footfall , car light or sudden movement is liable to wake you . leaving the sleeping camp just before 6 a.m. also presented a whole new side of davos : the supplier class made up of e-car drivers , safety officers , food vendors and others who are all up well before dawn making the wef work for the 0.1 percent .  rainbow wave : jin xing , one of monday night \\'s crystal award winners , is known as the chinese oprah , but most interestingly she gained fame and a devoted following by detailing her journey from male army colonel to female tv personality . that prominence is n\\'t quite matched in the rest of the program , but this year there are three official wef sessions on lgbtq themes , including \" free to be ( lgbti ) \" from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on wednesday at the swiss alpine high school auditorium . glaad and the ariadne getty foundation are going big on thursday , including a dinner with yo-yo ma . the goal : lgbtq advocates want to send the message that wef \\'s biggest partners want these issues elevated up davos \\' agenda .  davos goggles ? \" davos is the place where conflicts are averted , business is started , disputes are finished \" -- so said ursula von der leyen in her monday address . if you are scratching your head to come up with which conflicts were averted in davos , you are not the only one .  reports corner  sluggish growth : that \\'s the 2020 forecast by imf chief kristalina georgieva , and one big underlying culprit is none other than trade wars . \" global growth remains sluggish ... adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty read : trump ... the underlying causes for trade tension are still with us , \" she said . but it \\'s not just trade : \" geopolitical tensions in the middle east \" and \" the dramatic impact that climate shocks can have as seen recently in australia and parts of africa \" are also factors .  side note : is n\\'t it interesting how australia gets a name-check , but african countries are lumped together ?  oh the hypocrisy : a report by greenpeace highlights that 24 banks which regularly attend the wef have provided $1.4 trillion of financial support for the fossil fuel industry since the paris agreement set new emissions reduction goals in 2015 . more in this write-up by the guardian .  a pessimistic global elite -- pwc global ceo survey : ceos worldwide recorded a record level of pessimism in this year \\'s pwc survey of some 1,500 chief execs in 83 countries . that \\'s despite the fact that only two years ago , the 2018 ceo survey recorded a level of optimism never seen before when it comes to worldwide economic growth .  tough times for democracy and capitalism : according to the edelman trust barometer , 56 percent of respondents to a survey across 28 countries worldwide agreed that \" capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world . \" at tuesday morning \\'s launch event , former danish pm helle thorning schmidt said \" i am worried business will not do enough to support democracy . we need all the help we can get . \" microsoft president brad smith added : \" fix democracy first . we \\'ll find a way to do

warm meal are nil . head to the nearest supermarket -- their cantines serve warm food all day .  badge hierarchy : this year , there are two levels of hotel badges ( and a very long line to pick them up , if you have n\\'t already ) : \" strategic partner hotel badges \" -- all hotels , all days -- and \" regular , \" which are for one day only .  grow-ho-ho : facebook \\'s own promotional magazine , grow , is being stocked next to the harvard business review , arab news , ft and ny times in the belvedere hotel lobby . its cover is a \" 50 over 50 \" list of entrepreneurs ... they

a tree . as of monday night , they \\'d given away 3,759 of them .  ott : some chalets are as tall as six storeys and come with teams of drivers , chefs and yoga instructors . a full-time davos driver will set you back $10,000 for the week , if the amount one large consulting firm has paid up is any indication . corporations are taking over not only shopfronts ( hence the dearth of lunch options ) but whole apartments above them and converting them into meeting and event spaces . some , like facebook , have erected temporary buildings that will disappear the week after davos .  **a message from

playbook . today \\'s the soft launch ; on tuesday , the serious business starts . catch up on sunday \\'s preview newsletter here .  driving the day  in case you have n\\'t noticed -- davos is going green : it \\'s wall-to-wall sustainability this year ( private jets aside , cough cough ) . you ca n\\'t escape climate exhortations on stage , on billboards , or even at the buffet line . wednesday will be a meat-free day at the wef .  slumming it : more photographic evidence that not everyone at davos is living it up in the lap of luxury . playbook is starting to wonder if there is n\\'t some subliminal messaging going on with all these twitter posts .  not slaloming it : and even if you \\'ve managed to get some more luxurious digs , there \\'s no rest up the mountain this year . mondays at past wefs might have included a leisurely day skiing or a late arrival for many participants , since not much happened before the official wef opening on monday evening . this year , agendas started filling up with a round of sunday night welcome drinks , while this afternoon you can find side events on everything from cryptocurrencies to cannabis and ceos . then the monday welcome drinks begin .  but davos is not monopolizing summitry today ...  british pm boris johnson is busy with the inaugural u.k.-africa investment summit , which will feature more than 20 of africa \\'s 54 leaders , who are in london today . while that \\'s more than the african leadership contingent in davos , it \\'s only around half the number of african leaders who turned up to beijing and moscow in recent months for similar summits .  some european politics : european commission president ursula von der leyen will have to ponder a tempting offer : local paper tages-anzeiger reports that during a bilateral meeting today , swiss president simonetta sommaruga will offer additional financial help for the eu \\'s migration and climate change policies -- in exchange for more favorable conditions when it comes to the eu-switzerland framework agreement , which has been in the works for ages .  macron is choosing france and gathering 200 french and foreign ceos , for the third year in a row , in versailles . sunday evening , macron announced ? 4 billion in new investments from companies like msc , coca-cola andastrazeneca . jpmorgan chase announced plans to double its staff in paris in coming years as it relocates some of its services from london after brexit , though the u.k. capital will remain far ahead of paris in terms of headcount .  meanwhile , google and alphabet ceo sundar pichai is in brussels today . he will meet with digital and competition chief margrethe vestager and europe \\'s green deal vice president frans timmermans .  davos twofers : these ceo meets have one thing in common : they \\'re piggybacking on davos , with more and more corporate and government leaders gathering in the fourth week of january . they either use davos as the anchor for a meeting-packed europe trip , or they use it as the hook to get people to their own events -- a kind of two-for-one deal behind the wef \\'s back .  \\' make the world cool again \\' : if you see flowers and koala bears trekking through the snow en route from landquart to davos , do n\\'t be alarmed ( unless you \\'re a climate offender ) : climate activists dressed in costumes , holding banners that call for people to \" ignore the donalds and listen to the gretas , \" set off sunday on the three-day , 40-kilometer ( 25 mile ) , frigid hike .  and they \\'ve already left some traces along the way : you might see \" no planet b \" in the snow on your way in today , as rte \\'s will goodbody did .  things to ponder  have we peaked ? apparently some think we have reached the turning point on a host of the most important characteristics of the post-world war ii western world : globalization and capitalism . and as a result , we will be seeing more corporate responsibility given to stakeholders , with more concrete work to fight climate change and inequality . if it sounds a little familiar , that \\'s because we \\'ve heard it before , but playbook will keep an open mind throughout this week and look for signs of this momentous change . bloomberg has a rundown of a few other areas in which the world has reportedly peaked .  the new power-brokers : most people did n\\'t know what a cso was

with every global conference now looking and feeling like davos ( think halifax security forum , munich security forum , german marshall fund conferences , nato engages , doha forum ) : what is davos anymore ? decision-makers and experts seem to travel around a conference circuit tearing their hair out over populism on big white sofas arranged in semi-circles against blue backdrops . then there are competitors who borrow liberally from the wef format , such as concordia summit . and to top it off : there \\'s more programming outside the congress center than inside it , putting pressure on the wef business model . the wef \\'s success is making it a victim of global elite hyperinflation .  cherchez les femmes : gender parity has n\\'t reached the davos summit yet . there are 2,800 participants from more than 118 countries , according to the wef , and yet only 24 percent are women . some might say that \\'s progress ( the wef has been stuck at around 20 percent female participation for many years ) , but still not enough . wef points out that this is more than the 21 percent share of ministerial posts women hold worldwide , and well above the ratio of female ceos globally .  the radical new choice : just stay home . more often than not , wef press releases herald a record number of leaders and ceos and ministers heading to davos . this year the numbers are impressive -- but flat : around 280 senior public leaders , including more than 50 national leaders . for corporate denizens of davos , quite a few among playbook \\'s contacts are skipping this year \\'s event with a shrug .  a more radical choice ? a co-creator of occupy wall street attending . \" rejecting davos is easy when one has not been invited to attend , \" micah white writes . so he \\'s coming and committing \" reputational suicide \" -- it \\'s all very dramatic , but in a constructive way . \" what i discovered is that davos is not one thing . there are many davoses at davos . and it is possible to reject one or more sides of the gathering while still finding revolutionary potential in another aspect of it , \" white said . we \\'ll have to check in with him at the end to see how many of his goals he managed to achieve .  who \\'s not : french president emmanuel macron , ever the disrupter , is still staying away -- but not without having his own mini french davos , called choose france ( cheekily taking advantage of ceos coming to davos to make a stop in paris first and discover all the ways macron says his reforms have improved the investment environment . at least that \\'s the elys ?

( a good handful of his fellow eu commissioners are actually going to davos . )  it \\'s a kind of \" back to the future \" exercise , given that klaus schwab -- the founder and executive chairman of the wef -- has always advocated long-term sustainable capitalism ( see his original 1973 davos manifesto ) . and yet , it \\'s inescapable that in providing a platform for engagement with all manner of ceos and controversial regimes , davos is n\\'t just a place of consensus and dialogue -- it \\'s also a platform used by those leaders for reputational airbrushing . that leads playbook to ask : is davos one of the reasons we need a new type of capitalism ?

\" i think he should , \" she said .  asked why so much data tracking is necessary , sandberg said facebook will roll out a \" clear history \" function on the site to help users minimize it . she rejected the idea of a subscription model though , because it would mean \" most people ca n\\'t afford to use it . \"  **a message from philip morris international : we are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n\\'t do it alone . we ask the world \\'s leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . support the vision for a smoke-free future . learn more here. **  rating sandberg \\'s speech : out of five pandas . sandberg took pointed questions on the chin , issued some soft mea culpas the audience wanted to hear , but successfully defended the core facebook vision . after her remarks , and after initially leaving the stage , sandberg bounced back up to literally lean in and strike up a conversation with a female audience member who was wearing a daring blue fur hat . the cameras went wild . it was a deft but slightly too perfect political moment .  sandberg part ii -- inside her off-record reception for media : playbook was invited but unable to attend the off-the-record session . perhaps the most noteworthy observation from those who did attend : it mirrored the comments sandberg had given on the record just 90 minutes earlier .  today \\'s hot tickets  it \\'s george soros day . the billionaire slammed facebook at his 2018 annual dinner . who \\'ll be the punching bag this year ?

( though that conversation might further cement the idea that davos is more welcoming to nasty governments than it should be . ) bloomberg reports khalid al-falih \\'s \" travel plans are still in flux , so it \\'s still possible , albeit unlikely , he makes a flying visit to davos on friday . \"  refunds please ! our stateside colleague daniel lippman reports that a white house official told

collapse : the wef really wants you to know that slower growth does n\\'t equal recession . the forum predicts central banks are likely to moderate monetary policy to keep economic \" soft spots \" from turning into sharp declines , and says it hopes the opening up of china \\'s market will soften the blows . \" slowing down in china is not a collapse , \" noted fang xinghai , the vice chairman of the china securities regulatory commission , in davos . economic experts predict 6-percent growth in china for 2019 , which seems strong , but is often regarding as the tipping point into social

\" unleashing of animal spirits \" to help the economy grow . he praised \" beautiful coalitions \" and repeated the claim that isis has been defeated . he rejected the idea that conflict with china is inevitable , but said transparency and fairness is needed from beijing to avoid trade and other clashes . he likewise said the u.s. and russia are not \" destined to be antagonists but it will take a russian change \" to keep the peace .  on reforms he wants to see in nato , the un and eu : \" i do n\\'t have time today to go into each of them ... but it \\'s not about taking these institutions down , \" pompeo said . he added that \" voters have tuned out politics \" and are revolting around the world . \" people are asking questions that have n\\'t been asked , or have n\\'t been taken seriously for a very long time , \" pompeo said , characterizing donald trump \\'s election as a fightback against \" low expectations . \"  pompeo rated:playbook gives his speech . his prepared text was n\\'t memorable , but he talked soft and angled hard on the wef \\'s weak point : that its elite audiences avoid hard questions about how they got to be so successful .  brazilian offer you ca n\\'t resist : brazilian president jair bolsonaro gave the wef crowd another opportunity to choose between their collective sense of responsibility as citizens of everywhere and the business opportunities that a strict -- or should we say brutal -- anti-corruption agenda might bring . \" our measures will certainly provide you with incentives to do business , \" said bolsonaro , presenting the \" new brazil that we \\'re building \" as a place open to trading with the world and to investment . his plans include pouring cash into safety and security , he said , \" so you all can come visit with your families . \"  bolsonaro ( who strangely wore an overcoat on stage -- is that a new thing ? ) argued environmental issues \" need to go hand-in-hand \" with economic development , meaning \" one must not emphasize one over the other , and insisted only 9 percent of brazil \\'s soil was used by farmers today .  where were the women ? at tina brown \\'s annual women of impact dinner , hosted with credit suisse for the eighth time . the key speeches were from michelle bachelet , who was recently appointed as the united nations high commissioner for human rights

director-general marco lambertini , whose organization is pushing for the new deal .  lambertini \\'s challenge to wef attendees : \" this is the group of people that accounts for most of the carbon

sustainable , we \\'re heading towards a collapse of the food system . we need to green that system , with clear targets . \"  lambertini says we are not doing enough on the climate , but should n\\'t stop there anyway : \" if climate is dangerous enough for business , do n\\'t think that a collapse of the ocean of the forest system , will be less dangerous . \"  lambertini on bolsonaro : brazil \\'s strongman president started his term by making it easier to deforest the amazon . \" bolsonaro is not the first , \" said lambertini . \" and look what happened when trump announced the u.s. withdrawal from paris : a wave of companies , states and mayors , stepped up and said \\' we \\'re still in , we want to contribute even if the government does n\\'t . \\' sometimes , these kind of radical views trigger and accelerate reaction from society , but of course they are also a concern . \"  what would lambertini tell bolsonaro if he ran into him in davos ? \" i would like to say that people like trump , bolsonaro -- sovereignists , unilateralists , populists -- were not elected on anti-environmental agendas . the majority in america are concerned about climate change . they

optimistic : the forum is full of \" can-do \" people who , to be fair , have done many valuable things . but what davos-goers tend to collectively recoil at is bearers of bad news , or those who doubt everything can be \" win-win . \"  if that sounds like a fundamental clash , that \\'s because it is .  how else do you explain organizations repeatedly warning about extreme inequality at the wef , while the decision-makers who attend the forum ( and their companies ) grow markedly wealthier , some of them exponentially so , off the back of cheap debt and tax avoidance . that might be unfair but manageable if the wages and opportunities of the global middle and working classes were n\\'t stagnating in many countries . a new worldwide unicef survey of 10,000 youth demonstrated staggeringly simple asks : more jobs and better education . something \\'s got to give to fund those demands -- perhaps higher tax . if not , the response to exponential wealth might be exponential

can apple sustain strong momentum amid coronavirus fears ?  apple has reported record results for the three months to december , beating wall street estimates .  its newly launched iphone 11 series brought sales of the iconic smartphone back to the growth path while other new businesses such as wearables and subscription services achieved double-digit growth .  as apple is set to launch its 5g products later this year , such strong results demonstrated that the technology giant can still grow its iphone business even though the global smartphone market is slowing down .  the iphone business contributed us$56 billion in revenue for the quarter , up 8 percent from a year earlier . the strong growth was mainly due to the strong demand for the iphone 11 series . apple said iphone 11 , the cheapest model of the series , was the top-selling model for every week in december . the three models of the series also proved the most popular iphones .  apple has been shifting its business strategy for the iphone in view of the global smartphone market slowdown . it decided not to raise iphone prices for the           its predecessor , the iphone xr , and this attracted many smartphone users to give the iphone a try -- even if the latest models did not offer 5g mobile network connectivity .  many chinese customers , who have been using android smartphones for a long period of time , decided to switch to iphone 11 because of the lower price .  actually , apple tested the market with a much wider price band for its iphone products . the iphone is no longer a product just for the high-end market , but it can also serve the mid-range segment .  as the company sought to capture the mid-range clientele and even the entry-level market , it has been rumored that apple would launch an iphone with a smaller screen size in the first quarter this year .  it is said that the new iphone , dubbed iphone se2 , could come with a 4.7-inch screen and the latest a13 processor , and the price could be as low as us$39 .  some media outlets reported that apple was aiming to ship 15 million units           urged its partners to ship a total of 80 million units of iphones in the first half amid a stronger than expected demand .  unfortunately , apple \\'s ambitious plan could be affected by the outbreak of the new coronavirus in wuhan , the capital of central china \\'s hubei province .  the epicenter of the outbreak is near the iphone manufacturing bases . so far , business activities in the city have ground to a halt and employees have been told not to report back to work until february .  contingency plan  that could pose a negative impact on the supply of iphones in the near term . however , foxconn , an iphone contract maker , said that the company has a contingency plan to maintain its iphone business .  while no details have been provided , it can be assumed that foxconn will make the latest model in india and taiwan , where it also has iphone manufacturing plants .  the strong iphone demand led to an increase in the number of active users within apple ecosystem . apple said its           , up by over 100 million in the last 12 months .  the active installed base is a key indicator of apple users \\' stickiness to its ecosystem . such a huge user base serves as a solid foundation for apple to expand its service business , especially its subscription-based services .  apple said it had over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services , up 120 million from a year ago . it expects to surpass the 500 million mark during the march quarter .  the company has set a new target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of this year , and this means 40 percent of apple installed bases are paying for services .  unique service offerings  during the reporting period , revenue for services reached us$12.7 billion , up around 18 percent from a year earlier .  the company was able to attract users to try its unique service offerings such as payment , news , music and cloud storage .  for example , apple pay \\'s revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run           payment system was accepted in more public transport systems such as trains and buses in london , shenzhen and guangzhou .  apple news , on the other hand , attracted over 100 million monthly active users in the united states , australia and canada , and provided a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories .  such services did help to lock users to the iphone as it provided some exclusive content for them .  the coronavirus may eventually hit hardware sales in china as shops are closed .  but apple \\'s overall growth momentum should not be affected as its users continue to spend more on service subscriptions , and the rising penetration of apple pay will also help boost service revenue .  spacex , the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur elon

hundreds of homeless people to shelter homes established by pakistan tehreek-e-insaaf ( pti ) government in different areas of the province .  the initiative has been taken in the backdrop of the chilly weather that griped kp for the last couple of days to keep them safe of severe cold .  an official of the provincial government said on tuesday that shifting of poor to shelter homes continued in different districts of khyber pakthunkhwa where around 911 persons were shifted to 61 permanent and temporarily shelter homes in the province .  as many as 21 persons were shifted to shelter homes in abbottabad , 35 in bajaur , four in bannu , 30 in batagram , 60 in buner , 53 in charsadda , 30 in dera ismail khan , 21 in hangu , three in haripur , five in karak , 23 in           , 51 in lower dir , 20 in lower orakzai , six in malakand , 30 in mardan , 30 in malakand , 22 in orakzai , 394 in peshawar , seven in swabi and 16 in upper kohistan .  the deputy commissioners and officials of the social welfare department are looking after the process of shifting of homeless people to these shelter homes besides the distribution of food and other basic services .  in this connection , deputy commissioner lakki marwat , jahangir azam wazir visited a shelter home established at norang and met with people stayed there .  he also inquired about food , blankets , sweater , water and other necessary items . the deputy commissioner appreciated the food and other necessary services being provided to the homeless people . he directed the management of the shelter home to take extra care of people and provide them with better services . he directed for making special care of children and women .  meanwhile , on orders of deputy commissioner kohistan arif khan youafzai , assistant commissioner dauso headquarters and additional commissioner visited shelter           water and blankets for homeless people there . he directed the administration to provide best facilities to shelterless people .  similarly , deputy commissioner dir upper , khalid khattak also visited shelter home on dir-chitral road and inspected arrangements made for comforts of the passengers . he distributed blankets , sweaters and food items among poor people on this occasion .  the deputy commissioner shangla has established three temporary shelter homes at district headquarters alpuri , transport stand alpori and tehsil headquarters besham where shelterless are being looked after .  the district administration and social welfare department khyber pakthunkhwa are looking after poor people at shelters homes besides providing the much-needed relief including blankets and sweater to protect them from the severe cold that gripped khyber pakthunkhwa for the last couple of days

. too much ? sorry . could n\\'t resist . though it \\'s generally frowned upon to work marketing slogans into car reviews , like writing \" zoom zoom \" about a mazda or just blithely saying , \" it \\'s a jeep thing , \" route 66 was there first . the first time i travelled this way with nissan was over five years ago , and the kicks crossover suv/hatchback/subcompact -- pick one ; it \\'s all of these things -- was n\\'t in production yet .  seven back-to-back , 10-hour drive days is a fair test of many things about a vehicle . though we had the opportunity to switch out between the 2020 murano and altima , it was the trendy little kicks that had me most intrigued . i \\'d driven the 2018 , and we had the 2019 because the 2020 was still a few weeks in the offing . no matter . the 2019 offers           vehicle if you \\'re shopping in this segment .  oh , this segment . crowded and noisy , all yelling , \" over here ! \" to stand out . with sales of sedans wilting and car sales overall dropping , manufacturers know they have to define their target with increasing accuracy . safety , space , fuel economy , price , reliability . consumers want , and can have , it all . nissan knows this , and has placed the kicks at a sweet spot in its lineup .  first , the safety . seven airbags , automatic emergency braking and auto high beams are standard on all kicks . the sv and sr trims -- the latter of which we drove -- have blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert . it also sports nissan \\'s intelligent around view monitor with moving object detection ( mod ) , four cameras positioned to deliver a 360-degree bird \\'s eye view of the vehicle , the monitor offering split-screen closeups . for 2020 , safety shield 360 will be standard on all trim levels , which includes six           , rear emergency braking , front emergency braking with pedestrian detection , and rear cross-traffic alert .  got ta hand it to the kicks , it has the space . lots of it . great headroom , and we were also chucking full sized suitcases into the back , along with a lot of other gear , with ease . i \\'m a hardcore hatchback fan , and getting a subcompact crossover with this much space and clearance was a nice surprise . the backseats are okay for a couple of kids , but nothing you \\'d want to cover 4,000 kilometres in as an adult .  the fronts , however , are nissan \\'s zero gravity seats . created using technology perfected by nasa and available through open patents , the idea is to create a seat that removes pressure points . if astronauts have to be in space for weeks or months , how do you keep them the most comfortable ? anyone who has unfolded themselves from a car on a road trip knows the stretching and un-crunching has to happen at regular intervals .           , and the proof was in the forgetting : i forgot about the seats . i have back issues , i \\'d signed up for a seven day grueling trek across eight states , and i had no issues .  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  2019 nissan kicks  the styling is adorable , which it would totally mind me saying . but it is . it \\'s darling , especially the two-toned sr version i was driving . the interior does n\\'t live up to the outer promise , but the bose sound system is good and the speakers built into the driver \\'s headrest are fun . the console is a little pedestrian , though not much different than everything else in this segment at this price point . oh , and those seats ...  it \\'s a vehicle that does better in town than on places like route 66 , as it struggles to hold its place on the 120 km/h speeds on the interstate .           surefooted as it is turning on a dime in tight urban cores . it \\'s certainly got the nimbleness it needs from the 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine with 122 horspower , if not the juice to let you put your boot into it at high speeds . unlike others in the segment , the kicks is front-wheel-drive-only , but there \\'s no denying it \\'s fuel economy is a winner because of it . it \\'s relatively light weight of 1,200 kilograms helps the kicks earn an impressive rating of 7.2 l/100 kilometres combined .  why should you throw the kicks onto your shopping list ? bang for the buck . the loaded up 2019 sr trim we tested comes in at $23,398 . the base s starts at $18,298 , with the sv coming up the middle at $21,298. \\n this copy is for your personal non-commercial use only . to order presentation-ready copies of toronto star content for

watching new virus closely  experts are concerned the world could see another global outbreak of a new respiratory illness related to sars -- but there are still too many unknown factors to know how serious it is just yet .  as the situation unfolds , the lessons learned from dealing with sars are top of mind for some .  the new strain of a virus called coronavirus has killed two people in china since new year \\'s eve , with more than 40 infections reported there . infected travellers have also been confirmed in both thailand and japan . the public health agency of canada has implemented enhanced screening measures at airports in toronto , montreal and vancouver .  dr. kamran khan is an infectious disease physician at st. micheal \\'s hospital and a university of toronto researcher who studied airport           concerned this virus , said to have originated at a fish market in wuhan , china , has evolved the capability to spread from person to person and could soon reach outside of asia .  khan said the fact that the fish market in wuhan closed on jan. 1 , but there have since been more reported infections , even in the past 48 hours , is an indication that people are getting infected from person-to-person transmission .  it \\'s unknown how efficient the disease is in spreading from person to person , or how severe and quickly the symptoms develop .  \" what we do n\\'t necessarily see are the people who might have the same illness but it \\'s a much milder form , \" khan said .  \" and maybe they do n\\'t wind up going to the hospital . ... whenever there \\'s a new disease that emerges , we often ( at first ) just see the tip of the iceberg . \"  you might be interested in ...  there are several factors that could make this new coronavirus           does n\\'t seem as deadly as sars , meaning infected people are more likely to travel , move around and spread the disease than if they were bed ridden .  \" it actually is a little bit early to tell because there \\'s still many unknowns about this virus . but what i will say is when we look back at sars we saw something that was very , very deadly , \" khan said , noting that disease had a roughly 10 per cent fatality rate .  \" it does not seem to have the same level of severity of illness as we saw during sars ... keep in mind that viruses often are continuously evolving and shifting and changing , and so it is also possible that a virus could start to mutate and evolve in a way that makes it either spread more easily or become more virulent , more dangerous and deadly to people , \" he added .  with chinese lunar new year approaching next weekend , there is even greater chance of the disease leaving the asian region and spreading globally           weeks will be important to watch .  there is also the fact the incubation period for this virus , or the window of time before an infected person notices symptoms , can be up to two weeks . it puts airports and border agencies in a tricky situation because they \\'re unlikely to detect the virus by individual inspections -- people are more likely to develop the illness after they \\'ve already left the airport .  you might be interested in ...  as of now , canada has opted to educate travellers on what symptoms to look out for , as the onus is on individuals to report if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms as soon as possible .  he added that information about infection and deadly diseases needs to be disseminated much more quickly to prevent deadly outbreaks .  finally , he worries more viruses will spread from animals to humans due to the \" industrialization of agriculture and the disruption of wildlife ecosystems . \"  \" it \\'s really something for us to think carefully about is that our health ,

enzyme needed in the treatment of a hereditary disease called \" phenylketonuria \" . phenylpyrovirogradnaya oligophrenia is a disease that results in degradation of the amino acid called phenylalanine . this amino acid presents in protein-containing food . high levels of phenylalanine can cause problems of mental development throughout life . if diet therapy is not used among children under two , then such violations lead to irreversible deviations in the development of the brain . increasing the level of phenylalanine in the blood of an adult can reduce the level of mental abilities and reaction speed .  director of the ikbfu \\'s institute of living systems , olga babich said :  \" today scientists are looking for new ways of treatment of hereditary diseases . phenylketonuria is one of such diseases , it causes accumulation of toxic products in blood due to the metabolism malfunction in a body which it caused by insufficient amount of phenylalanine amino acid . the frequency of distribution of phenylketonuria among children in the world on average is one out of           1 : 4370 . in russia , the frequency of phenylketonuria averages 1 : 7000 . the most common is the classic form of phenylketonuria , in which present-day diet therapy ( exclusion of phenylalanine from the diet ) is the only effective treatment \" .  according to the scientist , there are more ways of treating this disease emerging now . for example , one of the ways is enzymotherapy - enzyme treatment . but in russia those methods are not used due to the lack of available technologies . while the most promising is the use in the treatment of an enzyme called \" l-phenylalanine-ammonium lyase \" , both in the form of injections and capsules/pills , which breaks down phenylalanine to safe products . the therapeutic use of this enzyme is limited by its instability , especially in the acidic environment of the stomach . therefore , the main challenge for scientists is to develop a stable capsule for the enzyme l-phenylalanine-ammonium lyase .  babich emphasized :  \" as part of this study , a team of scientists developed the capsule shell composition for           carrageenan and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose . the effect of different storage temperatures of the enzyme in encapsulated form on its activity was also studied . we found that for all of the proposed capsule formulations , the most suitable storage temperature for the drug is 25 ? c. at capsule storage temperatures of 4 ? c and 30 ? c after 6 months , a significant decrease in enzyme activity was noted , up to 90% . the next stage of research will be devoted to studying the mechanisms of destruction of capsules with l-phenylalanine-ammonium lyase under model conditions close to the conditions of the human gastrointestinal tract , since in the future the developed capsules will be used for replacement therapy of phenylketonuria \" . referencebabich et al .

study published on wednesday in the journal of medical virology showed that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the novel coronavirus that had caused 17 deaths in central china \\'s hubei province .  scientists from peking university health science center school of basic medical sciences , the first affiliated hospital of guangxi university of chinese medicine , ruikang hospital affiliated to guangxi university of chinese medicine , ningbo university \\'s school of medicine , and wuhan university of bioengineering carried out a comprehensive analysis on the existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus , the xinhua news agency reported .  they used a method called \" relative synonymous codon usage \" ( rscu ) bias to compare rna sequences of different animal species .  snake was one of the animals being sold in wuhan \\'s huanan seafood wholesale market before its closure . the market is believed to be related to most of the infected cases .  results obtained from the analyses suggested that the new virus 2019-ncov appeared to be a           .  the recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein , which recognizes cell surface receptor . additionally , their findings suggested that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-ncov based on its rscu bias resembling snake compared to other animals .  taken together , the research results suggested that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans .  glycoprotein is a group of conjugated proteins containing small amounts of carbohydrates .  chinese health authorities have posted the full genome of 2019-ncov in the genetic sequence database of u.s. national institutes of health and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data , according to u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . \\n a new strain of coronavirus that emerged in china may have

pinterest  linkedin  whatsapp  email  a new strain of coronavirus that emerged in china may have originated in bats or snakes , according to genetic analysis of the virus that has so far killed 17 people .  the theories are based on examination of the genome sequence of the virus released by authorities in the wake of the outbreak , with two studies pointing to the likely role of bats in the outbreak .  one study , published tuesday in the journal science china life sciences , which is sponsored by beijing \\'s chinese academy of sciences , looked at the relations between the new strain and other viruses .  it found the coronavirus that emerged from china \\'s wuhan was closely related to a strain that exists in bats .  \" bats being the native host           logical and convenient reasoning , though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans , \" the researchers from several institutions in china wrote in the paper .  \" to search for ( a ) potential virus reservoir , we have carried out a comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison . results from our analysis suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir , \" the paper says .  the researchers caution that their conclusions require \" further validation by experimental studies in animal models \" .  neither study explained how the virus may have been transmitted from animals to humans .  but they could offer clues to chinese authorities as they hunt for the source of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in the country and has been confirmed as far afield as the united states .  the food market where the deadly virus surfaced offered a range of exotic wildlife for sale , including live foxes , crocodiles , wolf puppies , giant salamanders , snakes , rats , peacocks , porcupines ,           director of the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , said in beijing on wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \" wild animals at the seafood market \" though the exact source remains undetermined .  many exotic species are still widely consumed in china or other asian countries where they are considered a delicacy -- like the civet or some rats or bats -- or for purported health benefits unproven by science . \\n all you need to know about the coronavirus  you have probably heard of the virus that broke out in china called the coronavirus -- the epidemic has also spread to other countries . more than 2,700 people have been infected in more than a dozen countries , including five confirmed cases in the united states , according to aljazeera .  what is coronavirus ?  according to the world health organization ( who ) , the coronaviruse belongs to a family of viruse that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) .  these viruses were originally transmitted between animals and people . sars , for instance , was believed to have been transmitted from civet cats to humans while mers travelled from a type of camel to humans .  several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans .  the name coronavirus comes from the latin word corona , meaning crown or halo . under an electron microscope , the image of the virus is reminiscent of a           chinese authorities on january 7 and named 2019-ncov , is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans .  little is known about it , although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed .  the first cases of coronavirus were reported in wuhan , china , on december 31 , 2019 . since then , the virus has spread to various other countries , including thailand , japan , united states , australia , france , vietnam , singapore , south korea , nepal , malaysia , japan , cambodia and taiwan .  what are the symptoms ?  according to the who , signs of infection include fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties .  in more severe cases , it can lead to pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome , kidney failure and even death .  the incubation period of the coronavirus remains unknown . some sources say it could be between 10 to 14 days .  reports say china has put major cities on lockdown , coupled with drastic travel restrictions for citizens and a ban on           e-commerce . other countries like taiwan are barring entry of people from infected cities , and the us is screening people for infections at major airports .  hopefully these measures will help curb the spread of the virus and ultimately put an end to the epidemic . \\n montreal-based acrobatic troupe cirque du soleil has also cancelled all performances in hangzhou , china as a precaution .  it says it made the decision to cancel performances of \" the land of fantasy \" show after chinese officials requested the temporary closing of all indoor activities with 100 or more people to stem the outbreak .  some countries such as the philippines have installed thermal scanners at airports to detect potential carriers of the disease when they arrive from china as those infected have displayed flu-like symptoms such as fevers .  tam says canada has no plans to follow suit .  \" in our experience during sars , we scanned millions of people and did n\\'t pick up a single case , \" she said .  \" what we know is if you get infected , there could be many days between being infected and being symptomatic or having a fever . \" \\n real number of wuhan coronavirus cases is 25,000 -- expert  a senior public health expert in hong kong , on monday said that the real number of people affected by the new coronavirus was close to 25,000 higher than the 2,744 cases confirmed by china \\'s national health commission .  gabriel leung , head of the li ka shing , faculty of medicine of the university of hong kong , disclosed this while briefing a newsmen in hong kong .  gabriel said that his team \\'s research indicated that there were likely around 44,000 cases in the incubation stage .  according to hong kong national health commission , eighty people had already died and 2,744 were confirmed infected across china as of monday , marking a rise in the death toll by 24 since sunday .  gabriel , who urged the hong kong government on preparedness in response to disease , said his team expected the case count to continue to double every six days in the absence of any public health intervention .  he estimated that the chinese city of chongqing would encounter the largest epidemic as the city of over           the city at the centre of the disease .  he said research indicated the peak of the outbreak would hit chongqing approximately two weeks before outbreaks in other major cities like beijing and shanghai hit their peak in april and may before dying down in june and july .  hong kong has confirmed eight cases of the deadly coronavirus that researchers believe originated in a wet market in wuhan where wild game including snakes , civet cats , and bats were sold for consumption .  chief executive carrie lam announced that residents of hubei province and non-hong kong citizens found to have visited the province after jan. 12 , would not be allowed entry into hong kong as of

\\n st. john \\'s man describes mood shift in china as coronavirus persists  just a few days ago , richard white could freely enter and leave the international grand bazaar , a major tourist attraction in the chinese city of urumqi .  the last time he went , armed police officers took his temperature before letting him in .  that \\'s the reality of the swiftly changing situation in china , even in xinjiang province . it \\'s about far away as you can get from the epicentre of a novel form of coronavirus that , as of friday , had killed 26 and sickened nearly 1,000 .  \" you can hear out the window people are still setting off firecrackers . even though a lot of people are nervous , there \\'s still a desire to celebrate . \"  - richard white  white spoke to saltwire just moments after the chinese lunar new year . he said even returning to his hotel after stepping out to watch fireworks resulted in questioning and a temperature check from police .  it \\'s getting serious  white is originally from st. john \\'s but           he teaches english at an elementary school in the city \\'s southern fengxian district .  as of friday , however , white was staying at a hotel in the far northwestern city of urumqi , the capital of xinjiang province .  urumqi is situated about 3,500 kilometres away from the more central hubei province , where 35 million people are locked down in the capital city of wuhan -- reportedly ground zero for the virus -- and surrounding cities .  white had to travel through wuhan via train about a week ago to get to urumqi , where he had made plans to visit during the holiday .  \" wuhan is. . . very centrally located in china and it \\'s a major transportation hub , \" white said .  \" at that point ( last week ) none of these measures had been put in place to restrict travel and control the outbreak because i do n\\'t think it was taken quite as seriously at that stage . \"  it \\'s clear that has changed .  public gatherings cancelled  visitors wearing           closed during the chinese lunar new year holiday following the outbreak of a new coronavirus , in shanghai , china on friday . - aly song/reuters  \" within the last three days , i \\'ve noticed all the hotel staff , they are all wearing masks . all of the police officers you see on the street and in xinjiang -- and there are a lot of them -- they are all wearing masks , \" he said .  white , too , has begun wearing one , though he questions the effectiveness .  even celebrations for the lunar new year have been scaled back with many public gatherings across the country being cancelled .  \" i \\'ve been talking to people in the city and they say , \\' we were supposed to have a big dinner with all of our family members but we do n\\'t feel safe to do that now , \\' \" white said .  \" you do n\\'t know if you \\'re going to be transmitting the virus unintentionally because it has an incubation period . \"  with           the new year , the school white works for , which was supposed to resume classes early next month , is suspending them until mid-february .  \" they want to give a chance for anyone that \\'s travelling to sort of show symptoms , \" he said .  while white had planned to return to shanghai much sooner , he has decided to stay in urumqi for the time being as he feels safer being so far away from the outbreak .  \" on social media , i have noticed , compared to my chinese friends , i think that westerners have been maybe overreacting a little bit . \"  - richard white  shanghai is less than 1,000 kilometres from wuhan and is much more densely populated .  white also said there have only been two confirmed cases in all of xinjiang , and both individuals had travelled to wuhan .  \" the equivalent that all the media has been talking about is the sars outbreak of 2003 , but in the last 15 years , china has become so much more connected           travel within the country and without , \" he said .  \" that \\'s the reason why the government is acting in such a harsh way to try and control this because there \\'s a really strong chance that it could spread quickly . \"  despite the measures being undertaken by authorities and a widespread feeling of nervousness among chinese citizens , white said there \\'s no mass panic , and that he does n\\'t feel overly concerned for his safety .  \" on social media , i have noticed , compared to my chinese friends , i think that westerners have been maybe overreacting a little bit , \" he said .  \" for the most part people are still trying to go about their daily lives , and i think maybe that \\'s because it \\'s the holiday season and they still want to enjoy family time and everything , \" he said .  \" you can hear out the window people are still setting off firecrackers . even though a lot of people are nervous , there \\'s still a desire to           keep monitoring the situation closely in the coming days and weeks to see when and how he will be able to return to shanghai to begin work again .  \" we live in that 24-hour news cycle so i do n\\'t know if when i wake up in the morning there will be another update from the government , \" he said . \\n related stories  the mix-up also raises questions about pre-surgery procedures in kenyan hospitals , especially on how to ensure the right patient is operated on the right place .  it also calls to question doctors \\' lack of commitment to their patients to ensure they receive the care they need to get well .  the daily nation , which investigated the scandal since wednesday , will not publish details of the patients out of respect for their privacy and because it was not clear on thursday if their families had been informed of the operation .  last evening , hospital management threw out this reporter by dramatically having security guards escort her out of the premises for making enquiries about the incident .  medics suspendedin an effort to limit the damage following our enquiries , the hospital \\'s chief operating officer lily koros issued a statement announcing the suspension of four medics who were at work on the fateful night .  they included the neurosurgeon , the ward nurse , theatre receiving nurse , and the anaesthetist .  \" the management has suspended the admission rights of a neurosurgery registrar and           the wrong patient , \" ms koros said .  the fact that ms koros was referring to the operation as \" apparent \" is probably an indication that the hospital was unwilling to publicly admit the error , and also that some of its procedures may have put the welfare of patients at risk .  identificationshe did not disclose the identity of the patients , only saying that the hospital will \" advise on the cause of action to be taken \" . the doctor \\'s suspension ends friday .  the patients were received and both admitted in the hospital \\'s ward 5a , which houses general surgery and trauma patients without fractures .  patients wear name tags on their hospital gowns in this ward and investigations will look into how the two were given the wrong tags .  the tags are the patient \\'s only method of identification .  it appears in this system , the surgeon will have no contact with the patient , waits in the theatre , and follows the information in the files to carry out critical surgery .           telling they were operating on the wrong patient because he was unconscious , \" a source , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter , said .  \" besides , the file details and patient label tallied . \"  surgery stoppedthe team only realised the mistake more than two hours into the operation after opening the head of the wrong patient , only to find a swollen brain but no blood clot .  after consulting a senior neurosurgeon on call , the operating doctor was instructed to proceed no further , clean up the area and close the head .  the doctor examined a ct scan of the patient and his file before recommending surgery .  both showed that there , indeed , was a blood clot in his head .  however , the scan was from the wrong patient and the team did not discover the mistake until after the surgeon was halfway into the operation .  recoveryin a miracle of some sort , the nation was informed that both patients were in good condition , and that the           he had improved significantly .  few medical errors are as vivid and terrifying as those that involve patients who have undergone surgery on the wrong body part , undergone the incorrect procedure , or had a procedure intended for another patient .  wrong-site surgery may involve operating on the wrong side , as in the case of a patient who had the right side of her vulva removed when the cancerous lesion was on the left , or the incorrect body site . \\n slurry spreading season : when can you start ?  fertiliser and slurry spreading will once again be allowed over the coming days and weeks as the closed period comes to an end in some parts of the country from as early as next week .  the date from which you can begin to spread slurry , artificial fertiliser and farmyard manure from will depend on the part of the country you are located in , according to the department of agriculture , food and the marine .  broken down into three separate zones -- a , b and c -- going from the south-east and east to the north and north-west , the three regions range from opening on monday , january 13 , to saturday , february 1 .  a further breakdown of spreading open dates and county zones is as follows :  ahead of these dates , teagasc has issued a number of tips for farmers chomping at the bit to get spreading .  advertisement  farmers are advised to make sure they have fertiliser in the yard and slurry agitated in time to be able to avail of a           spreading period reopens .  it must be noted , however , that all should be mindful of the weather forecast . farmers should make the most of a dry spell when it comes , but watch out for heavy rainfall and poor ground conditions .  slurry is the cheapest form of nitrogen ( n ) , phosphorous ( p ) and potassium ( k ) on farms . slurry should be spread where grass covers are low and on soils deficient in p and k.  farmers can spread slurry on heavier covers -- up to 1,200kg dm/ha -- using applicators such as the trailing shoe in dry weather .  finally , farmers are reminded to make sure to use a protected urea or urea product when spreading chemical fertiliser this spring ; this will minimise the risk of n leaching on farms .  safety first  most importantly , farmers should take care when spreading slurry and stop taking risks .  agitate on a windy day , open all shed doors and work upwind at all times ;  remove all livestock and control           ;  keep tank openings secure and do not enter the tank at any stage ;  avoid working alone .  further safety guidelines will be brought to you on agriland over the coming days , so watch this space . \\n \\' everyone in orania is woke \\' : a journey to sa \\'s most notorious town -- in recent years , more savvy leadership has

will turn two holiday camps , including a former military barracks , into quarantine zones for people who may have come into contact with carriers of the wuhan virus , officials announced thursday .  the international financial hub has been on high alert for the virus , which has killed 17 people since the outbreak started in central china .  the same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak 17 years ago .  nearly 300 people in hong kong were killed by sars , a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth .  so far two people in the city have tested positive for the new coronavirus -- which is similar to the sars pathogen . both had visited wuhan in recent days . they are being treated on isolation wards in hospital .  the gambling hub of macau , which is hugely popular with mainland tourists , also confirmed two cases this week . on thursday , macau \\'s tourism bureau announced it was cancelling all official           kong , officials announced they would convert two holiday parks to isolate any potential cases while they await test results .  \" we will have a full team of staff to operate the quarantine camps , \" wong ka-hing , the director of the centre for health protection , told reporters .  wong said three people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to a camp in rural sai kung district later thursday .  another holiday camp , a former british military barracks on hong kong island , was being prepared to serve as a quarantine facility .  -- scarred by the past --  the three people are the wife of one of the confirmed cases and two medical staff , health officials said .  those who test positive for the wuhan virus will then be treated in isolation wards at the city \\'s hospitals , but the holiday camp quarantine zones will lower the risk of the virus spreading while people await results .  the same system was used during the sars outbreak , which           is now far more conscious of contagion and hygiene standards .  door handles , elevator buttons and escalator handles in the city \\'s myriad skyscrapers and metro stations are routinely sterilised multiple times a day , while an unguarded sneeze on the crowded subway can cause neighbouring commuters to scramble for distance .  surgical face masks are ubiquitous , not just in the winter flu season , with many shops selling out in recent days .  hong kong \\'s difficulties in battling sars were compounded by the veil of secrecy that surrounded the outbreak on the authoritarian mainland .  but officials insist they are more prepared than 2003 and say chinese authorities are being much more transparent with data .  nonetheless , suspicion of the mainland remains high in hong kong , especially as it convulses with anti-government protests sparked by fears beijing is eroding the city \\'s unique freedoms .  on thursday , health officials were questioned by reporters as to why they were n\\'t advising all arrivals at the city \\'s high-speed train link with the mainland to fill out health declaration           extend the compulsory health declaration to cover the high-speed rail link , \" wong said .  he added that any decision to cancel lunar new year celebrations like macau has would need to be taken by the government .  officials have also been criticised by opposition lawmakers for allowing relatives of the first confirmed case to travel on to manila .  hong kong \\'s

first bank of england ( boe ) monetary policy decision of 2020 will be made at their london headquarters on thursday 30 january . this will be the last meeting for mark carney after a stint of over six years guiding the bank \\'s monetary policy .  will we see any change to monetary policy ?  the past fortnight has seen huge volatility in the market expectations of a rate cut . coming a month after the uk general election on 12 december , we have seen significant volatility around each economic reading released throughout recent weeks . initial signs of a november and december weakness came via declines in retail sales ( -0.6% ) , monthly gross domestic product ( gdp ) at -0.3% , and industrial production ( -1.2% )           , there was plenty of reasoning behind the flurry of dovish comments that came our way from the likes of carney and monetary policy committee ( mpc ) members michael saunders , silvana tenreyro and gertjan vlieghe . adding those names to the already dovish jonathan haskel , there is a strong chance we will see the mpc cut rates on thursday .  however , the past week has seen that dovish message undermined somewhat , with the provisional january purchasing managers index ( pmi ) surveys showing a huge jump in the services sector . if confirmed , that rise would see services grow at the fastest rate in 16 months . this highlights a likely economic recovery that could take shape over the coming months . however , with a coronavirus curveball now raising the possibility of a china-focused shock to the global growth picture , we are seeing expectations of a rate cut increase once again . this takes us back into a position where there is a market majority for a cut , with options markets pricing in a 52% chance that carney will lead           we look out for ?  after a long period of stability , the recent election and brexit agreement has helped free up the boe to take action if they see it as being necessary . this is a genuine coin-toss meeting , with the 52% market expectation of a rate cut highlighting that we are almost guaranteed volatility on the day . it is worthwhile noting that at 0.75% , the headline interest rate is unlikely to fall much further beyond the 25 basis-point move that many are calling for . thus , there is a strong chance we will see a \\' hawkish cut \\' which sees the bank provide commentary that paves the way for a less dovish stance going forward .  this meeting also sees the release of the quarterly monetary policy report , or inflation report . this provides forecasts for both growth and inflation , which adds yet another dimension for traders to keep their eye on . given the potential coronavirus implications on growth and energy prices , there is plenty for the committee to consider . not to mention the phase           where now for the pound ?  gbp/usd has been on the slide in the lead up to this meeting , with fears over a potential rate cut clearly impacting confidence despite recent gains . however , this brings us back into a provisional support trendline , following a break below trendline and fibonacci support . ultimately , we need to see a break below $1.2962 to bring about a more bearish outlook for this pair . until then , there is a strong chance that we will see the bulls come back into play as the pair seeks to build on the recent intraday trend of higher highs and higher lows .  this information has been prepared by ig , a trading name of ig markets limited . in addition to the disclaimer below , the material on this page does

freedom of speech and expression and the right to carry on any trade or business using the internet , is constitutionally protected . the apex court also directed the jammu &amp; kashmir authorities to immediately restore internet services in all institutions providing essential services , including hospitals and banks .  the freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to practice any profession or carry on any trade , business or occupation over the medium of internet enjoys constitutional protection under article 19(1) ( a ) and article 19(1) ( g ) respectively , ruled the three-judge bench headed by justice nv ramana . \" the restriction upon such fundamental rights should be in consonance with the mandate under article 19 ( 2 ) and ( 6 )           , \" the court said .  the verdict came on a batch of pleas which had challenged curbs imposed in jammu &amp; kashmir after the narendra modi government \\'s abrogation of provisions of article 370 on aug. 5 , 2019 . these batch of pleas were different from another set of petitions which challenge constitutional validity of abrogation of article 370 , being heard by a five-judge constitution bench .  the apex court also ruled that repetitive orders under section 144 of the criminal procedure code amount to an abuse of power .  the power under section 144 , crpc can not be used to suppress legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights .  supreme court order  the supreme court in its judgment dealt with the process that governs internet shutdowns and restrictions imposed under section 144 of the code of criminal procedure .  on internet shutdowns , the court made it clear that all the orders which lead to an internet shutdown must be put out in public domain . the top court also made it clear that           orders .  \" the degree of restriction and the scope of the same , both territorially and temporally , must stand in relation to what \\'s actually necessary to combat an emergent situation , \\' \\' said the judgement by the top court bench headed by justice ramana .  the bench has also asked the administration in jammu and kashmir to review all shutdown orders within seven days as mandated under the rules .  it \\'s clear from the reading of the judgment that the court has found the current shutdown imposed in kashmir to be unconstitutional , raman cheema , an advocate practising cyber law , told bloombergquint .  agreed vrinda bhandari , an advocate specialising in technology and privacy . the court \\'s direction for making public all orders imposing internet shutdown is a leap forward as it makes such orders easier to be challenged in court by those who are aggrieved by them , she told bloombergquint .  the court has made it clear that the constitutional principles of necessity , proportionality and the need to first look for alternate means will           for people in places where the shutdown is still in effect , the judgment now enables them to approach the government seeking a copy of the order and then they can challenge these shutdowns in the high courts .  raman cheema , advocate practising cyber law  the bench also noted that this was a case where the two sides presented two pictures \" which are diametrically opposite and factually irreconcilable \" and the court has tried to balance the question of restrictions on grounds of national security and the freedom and rights of citizens .  there \\'s merit in the argument of security concerns , the bench said , while mandating that the citizens must be provided access to essential services , including access to government websites , hospital services and banking services through the internet .  but the judgment makes it clear that even shutdowns imposed on grounds of national security will be subject to judicial review , bhandari said .  the restrictions imposed under section 144 of the crpc -- which grants powers to magistrates to issue orders to maintain law and order           law and order , it said . the magistrate can issue orders to take preventive measures to disallow unlawful assembly -- which can refer to any gathering of more than five people who have a common object to use criminal force against the central or state governments .  the court also explained the process that must be followed before issuing orders under the section .  \" in a situation where fundamental rights of the citizens are being curtailed , the same can not be done through an arbitrary exercise of power ; rather it should be based on objective facts . the preventive/remedial measures under section 144 , crpc should be based on the type of exigency , extent of territoriality , nature of restriction and duration of the same , \" the top court judgment said .  vrinda said the judgment will give cautious optimism to those who have challenged these orders in the courts .  currently , high courts in india are hearing petitions challenging internet shutdown orders and restrictions imposed under section 144 crpc in the context of recent protests witnessed across the           to section 144 orders issued in the southern state during the protests against the citizenship amendment act . the allahabad high court is also hearing a suo motu petition challenging internet restrictions imposed during the anti-caa protests in the state .  \" the court \\'s ruling on section144 is even more progressive , \" bhandari said . \" the court here has made it clear that before issuing orders under the section , there has to be an assessment on whether any other less intrusive measures can be taken to control law and order . the judgment is a huge step forward in ensuring more accountability and transparency to deal with these issues . \" \\n maruti xl5 hatchback based on new wagonr spied testing video  by ajeesh kuttan - january 10 , 2020  india \\'s largest car manufacturer maruti suzuki last year launched xl6 mpv which was basically the premium version of the ertiga . the manufacturer is now working on another model which is based on maruti \\'s famous wagonr hatchback . the wagonr got a facelift earlier last year and became quite popular in the country . just like any other new-gen maruti suzuki vehicle , wagonr is also based on heartect platform which makes it bigger and spacious than the earlier version . the upcoming wagonr based vehicle will probably be known as xl5 and was recently spotted testing on indian roads under heavy camouflage .  the video has been uploaded by iab on their youtube channel and shows a heavily camaflouged hatchback being tested on road . from the rear it is quite evident that the car is based on wagonr . coming to the side the car is now riding on new alloy wheels which are similar to the one that we have seen on ignis . that is the only noticeable change in the           the front , you \\'ll start noticing more changes . the upcoming xl5 is likely to get a different design from the wagonr . from the video it looks like the car will have a bigger grille and split headlamp set up . it will get a led drl like many other modern day premium cars get in the country . the headlamp will be placed below the drl like the one we have seen in harrier and other cars .  lower part of the bumper gets a silver skid plate and fog lamps are also positioned on both sides of the bumper . changes will not only be seen on the outside but inside as well . the cabin is likely to receive an all black treatment with premium interiors like leather seats . the engine , however , will remain the same . we can expect a higher power-generating 1.2-litre engine that is available with the wagonr to power the premium version of the car too . however , we may also get to see the 1.0-litre engine option to keep the price competitive . as mentioned           just like xl6 , xl5 will also be sold via nexa dealerships . it is expected that maruti will launch the xl5 later this year .  about us  cartoq is india \\'s largest auto content company with more than 20 million users accessing the latest automobile news , new launches , reviews &amp; other

while raising public awareness for the said virus .  previously , the spread of hiv/aids was only largely prevalent with men who have sex with men ( msm ) but now the department of health ( doh xi ) has recorded new cases within the region with women and children who have been infected with said virus .  the regional epidemiology surveillance unit for the doh xi dr. cleo fe tabada is worried that the spread of hiv/aids will now be also prevalent with females and children .  \" the sad part is that hiv/aids is already starting to affect females and children because some of the msms are married

centers and public hospitals .  dr. tabada is looking forward to how the enhanced service delivery is going to positively           hiv-aids in the philippines .  \" as of today , we have more service areas because hospitals who were previously not equipped with hiv/aids management services have received upgrades to their capacity like the hospitals in the provinces have been oriented on what to do if they encounter a new case , \" dr. tabada said .  part of the solution to curtailing the spread of hiv/aids in the country is being able to document the scope of infection in the population that is why the government has made huge strides in identification and diagnosis of patients affected by the said disease .  \" several years ago , if there \\'s a case outside davao city it \\'s hard to handle because there are no available services but , at present , the department of health and local government units have enhanced its capacity to serve even to the extent of community health centers

whatever resources are necessary or take whatever decision is necessary to ensure that the protection of our citizens is maintained \" .  dr. tufton said that the travel advisory does not apply to other countries , such as the united states and canada , where the virus has reportedly surfaced on a smaller scale .  he said that based on information , those countries \" have identified a few cases and they have taken measures to isolate and deal with them , \" noting that the \" assessment of the risk associated with those jurisdictions are nowhere as great as in china \" .  dr. tufton

evolved from a cabinet consideration , was discussed with china \\'s ambassador to jamaica , his excellency tian qi , during a meeting at the ministry of foreign affairs and foreign trade on tuesday (

\" explored all the possibilities \" in treating with the virus .  \" it recognised the friendship that jamaica shares with china in a number of areas such as business , culture , and education where we have students there studying and we have chinese here teaching our locals . so the decisions taken around the travel advisory were based on the recognition of that friendship , \" he stressed .

her and decided to take crystal up for surgery . he removed her skin graft and decided to stitch the remaining portion to make sure that there wo n\\'t be any more hair growing on her face .  he thought it would be better to have a small scar than to have a pubic hair growing on the face . to make sure that the surgery is successful , he created a pocket and filled it with fluid that would allow the healing of the skin to take place easily . while crystal had to go on with her everyday life having a lump on her face because of the fluid , she was happy with the end           off her

as well as anyone with flue-like symptoms , will be prohibited from visiting patients at mclaren flint , the hospital announced in a news release .  the restrictions aim to limit the spread of

identify the mystery virus and its source .  health in china wuhan hospital  the chinese health authorities have ruled out severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) as the source of the mystery wuhan virus , as the number of infected people continues to climb .  some 59 people in the central chinese city have come down with what the authorities are calling a \" pneumonia of unknown cause \" , according to official figures released on sunday night . it is higher than the 44 reported last friday .  the city \\'s health authorities have also ruled out bird flu , influenza , adenovirus and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus , or mers-cov , as the cause .  but the wuhan municipal health commission also said in its update that the number of people in critical condition has dropped to seven from 11 previously , adding that all patients are in quarantine and in a stable condition .  many of the patients are sellers from a local seafood wholesale market in the           dec 12 and 29 .  besides seafood , the market is known to also sell live animals , including birds and snakes , and the organs of rabbits and other wildlife , according to media reports . ? \\n while the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced carbon dioxide emissions overall , it has also reportedly changed local pollution levels at hundreds of areas around the country , improving human health and increasing crop yields .  the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants in the us has reduced nearby pollution and its negative impacts on human health and crop yields , according to a new university of california san diego study .  the findings reportedly use the us transition in recent years from coal towards natural gas for electric power generation to study the local impacts of coal-fired unit shutdowns .  in particular , the burning of coal is said to create particulate matter and ozone in the lower atmosphere -- often experienced as \\' smog \\' -- which can affect humans , plants and regional climate . these pollutants ( aerosols , ozone and other compounds ) from coal burning can be damaging to human health when inhaled , and can also have negative effects on plant life .  burney reported that between 2005 and 2016 , the shutdown of coal-fired units saved an estimated 26,610 lives and 570 million bushels           . the inverse calculation , estimating the damages caused by coal plants left in operation over that same time period , suggests they contributed to 329,417 premature deaths and the loss of 10.2 billion bushels of crops , which is said to be approximately equivalent to half of year \\'s typical production in the us .  \" the unique contribution of this study is its scope and the ability to connect discrete technology changes like an electric power unit being shut down to local health , agriculture and regional climate impacts , \" burney said . \" we hear a lot about the overall greenhouse gas and economic impacts of the transition the us has undergone in shifting from coal towards natural gas , but the smaller-scale decisions that make up this larger trend have really important local consequences . \"  the analysis is said to provide a framework for communities and industries to more thoroughly and accurately assess the costs and benefits of local investments in energy infrastructure .  we use cookies to improve

coronavirus was genetically sequenced from a sample from one patient and subsequently found in some of the others affected in the city of wuhan , people familiar with the findings said . chinese authorities have n\\'t concluded that the strain is the underlying cause of sickness in all the patients who have been isolated in wuhan since the infection first broke out in early december , the people said .  chinese state media reported thursday that the unidentified pneumonia \" is believed to be a new type of coronavirus , \" citing experts . state media reported that the results were preliminary and more research was needed to understand the virus .  there are many known coronaviruses -- some can cause ailments like common colds in humans , while others do n\\'t affect humans at all . some -- such as severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars-coronavirus , identified in 2003 -- have led to deadly outbreaks , lending urgency to efforts to contain the current situation .  the number of reported cases of viral pneumonia in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , was 59 on sunday , rising from           health commission , with seven people in critical condition . no deaths have been reported .  the disease afflicting patients in wuhan has n\\'t been transmitted from human to human , and health-care workers have remained uninfected , according to city health officials as of sunday , suggesting that what is sickening them is for now less virulent than sars . those ill in wuhan are believed to have become sick through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market .  health experts say one risk is that the disease could become a bigger threat as tens of millions of chinese travel around the country during the lunar new year holidays that begin in just over two weeks .  health authorities in singapore and hong kong , cities that have direct flights from wuhan , have issued alerts and quarantined patients traveling from the region who show signs of fever or breathing difficulties .  the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention asked health-care providers and state and local health departments on wednesday to screen patients with severe respiratory illnesses about whether they           should be reported immediately to public health authorities , the u.s. public health agency said in a health advisory . no cases have been reported in the u.s. , the cdc said , adding that it is prepared to respond \" if additional public health actions are required . \"  in hong kong on tuesday , the government said it was taking precautions against a \" severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent . \" that it is seeking to make a statutory notifiable infectious disease , meaning doctors would need to report any suspected cases , and patients evading quarantine could be fined or jailed .  a visitor walked past a large photo depicting the 2003 sars epidemic at an exhibition , \\' 40 years through the lens , \\' at the national museum of china , in beijing , september 2018 .  photo : wu hong/epa/shutterstock  china was criticized for initially covering up sars , which was first detected in late 2002 but was disclosed only after it began spreading widely , eventually killing 774 people globally , according to the world           after reviews found that initial failures to contain and isolate patients with sars allowed it to proliferate across densely populated southern china .  the wuhan outbreak will test how much has changed .  \" we learned a bitter lesson in 2003 , and we do not want that to happen again , \" said alex lam , chairman of advocacy group hong kong patients \\' voices . \" china should immediately release their findings so doctors across the world can better know how to tackle this illness . \"  hong kong \\'s department of health , citing information from china \\'s national health commission , said the cause of the cluster of pneumonia cases detected in wuhan was still under investigation , but other known respiratory pathogens had been ruled out .  the main clinical symptoms of those affected by the wuhan outbreak are fever -- with a few patients having difficulty breathing -- and invasive lesions of both lungs , which show up on chest radiographs , the who said sunday .  a mourner wearing a mask to ward off sars under an umbrella           in 2003 .  photo : bobby yip/reuters  it is unclear what the underlying source of the disease is , though the reported link to a wholesale fish and live-animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals , the who said . bats , for example , are known reservoirs for coronaviruses , and have been found to transmit the disease to humans through a third vector such as a civet cat , as scientists found in the case of sars .  the pattern of the unexplained pneumonia cases linked to the market selling seafood and live game strongly suggests that this is a novel microbe jumping from animal to human , said k.y. yuen , chair professor of infectious diseases at the university of hong kong \\'s faculty of medicine .  researchers have determined that a large proportion of new infectious diseases in humans are transmitted via animals . such illnesses are referred to as zoonoses . two newer human coronaviruses , mers-cov and sars-cov , have been known to cause severe illness and death , according to the u.s. cdc .  the wuhan           to sars , a person familiar with the new findings said .  given the marked advances in hospital isolation facilities , infection-control training and laboratory diagnostic capabilities in the past two decades , it is unlikely that this outbreak will lead to a major 2003-like epidemic , mr. yuen said .  in wuhan , which has china \\'s first biosafety level 4 laboratory -- a specialized research laboratory that deals with potentially deadly infectious agents like ebola -- the market at the center of investigations has been shut since jan 1 .  in hong kong , badly hit by the sars virus , which claimed 299 lives locally in 2003 , residents have donned surgical masks on the streets and public transport in recent days , despite no local cases of the wuhan infection being confirmed . \\n gov . phil murphy yesterday highlighted some of his administration \\'s anti-opioid plans for 2020 .  providing local police and libraries with the opioid overdose reversal agent naloxone . a fresh outreach campaign , tied to a more effective treatment hotline . another attempt to tax opiate manufacturers to help offset new jersey \\'s costs in battling addiction .  these are among the concepts new jersey officials have in place -- or in mind -- for 2020 as they continue to address the state \\'s opioid epidemic , according to gov . phil murphy and members of his cabinet who participated in a public meeting on addiction wednesday .  while last year saw a 3% decline in the number of drug-related deaths in the state -- the first decrease in nearly a decade -- some 3,021 people still lost their life to illegal substances .  \" there \\'s no celebration , let me say that upfront , \" murphy told administration officials , treatment providers , law enforcement and individuals in recovery who joined him at the family guidance center , a nonprofit in warren county that provides substance abuse and mental health services           a blessed human being , each of them gone , each representing families around the state who will grieve their loss forevermore . \"  judith persichilli , acting commissioner of the state department of health , added : \" we need everyone to be cognizant that this is affecting families every day , with eight overdose deaths every day in new jersey . \"  planning for $100m in upcoming budget  the governor and his team reviewed their efforts in 2019 and highlighted some of their plans for the year to come ; murphy noted he has included $100 million in each of the past two state budgets to address opioid addiction and would likely do so again next month when he introduces his spending plan for fiscal year 2021 , which starts in july .  murphy said ongoing and new programs will continue to build on four existing areas of focus : improving data collection , expanding access to effective treatment , investing in social programs to address the underlying causes of addiction , and continuing to diversify the work of law enforcement , which is           \\'re taking that public health approach to this crisis . we \\'re focusing on prevention . we \\'re focusing on treatment . and we \\'re focusing on enforcement as well , \" state attorney general gurbir grewal said .  among the initiatives on the administration \\'s agenda is a plan to distribute free naloxone , or narcan , to municipal police departments and libraries , which -- as public spaces -- are now the site of overdoses and play an important role in new jersey \\'s efforts to address addiction , officials note . department of human services commissioner carole johnson said she and grewal sent letters with this offer to police officials on tuesday and by wednesday morning 80 departments had contacted her to express interest .  in february , dhs plans to launch new public outreach for the state \\'s reach nj hotline , which has counselors available 24/7 to connect individuals with treatment . officials said the $4 million campaign will include billboards , internet and cable commercials with messages developed through input from people in recovery and family members . one version includes a           hug him twice , in case it \\'s the last time . \"  renewed outreach  dhs had previously overhauled the reach nj system to make it more effective for callers seeking help . \" what we found when we inherited the line was that people were having to go through multiple layers to get to actual help , \" johnson said , \" so we redesigned the system so people can connect to a live counselor . \"  the outreach campaign and other elements of the murphy administration opioid response contrast with measures introduced under former gov . chris christie , who focused significant attention on addiction and created the reach nj hotline . but christie faced criticism for launching a costly advertising campaign that featured him prominently in promoting the hotline on tv .  murphy also said that he has not abandoned an idea he first announced as part of his budget proposal last year , for the state to impose a per-pill tax on companies that manufacture or distribute opioids ; the purpose would be to raise funds to offset the taxpayer tab for           have cost some companies as much as $5 million a year -- was designed to raise $21.5 million annually but failed to attract legislative sponsors in either the assembly or senate .  \" i want to go to the board rooms \\' ( of opioid makers ) financially to ask for a per-pill charge that we would then take and help us defray some of the $100 million we spend in this arena , \" murphy said wednesday .  by the numbers  the administration also released a wealth of opioid-related data from 2019 , including :  97 : the number of fewer drug-related deaths recorded in 2019 , versus 2018 ;  6% : the percentage decline in opioid prescriptions in 2019 ; prescription numbers have fallen by double digits over the last few years thanks to changes in state law and federal guidelines , and growing awareness among doctors and patients of the potential dangers ;  33,200 : the number of free naloxone doses dhs distributed to the public during a one-day , statewide effort in june , and to homeless shelters later in           responders trained to date through the doh \\'s 5 minutes to help initiative , designed to help them communicate with individuals who are experiencing an overdose and , hopefully , connect them with treatment ;  30% : the percentage increase in garden state pharmacies that offer naloxone to the public without a prescription ;  11 : the number of \" heroin mills \" destroyed in 2019 by state police ; four of these facilities were connected with 358 overdoses , 133 of which were fatal ;  80% : the percentage of heroin that included fentanyl , a more lethal synthetic opioid , based on samples submitted for testing by law enforcement ;  700 : the number of nonviolent offenders charged with minor drug crimes and diverted into treatment or recovery programs , instead of jail , through the attorney general \\'s operation helping hand initiative ;  26 : the number of doctors , pharmacists or other professionals who faced the loss of their license in 2019 because of prescribing violations involving opioids ;  16,000 ; the number of student athletes and parents who watched           them understand the addiction potential of prescription opioids ;  $7.8 million : grant funding made available in october to help county jails create or expand effective treatment programs ; 20 of the 21 counties have accepted funds ;  2,516 : the number of prisoners in state custody who are on medicated assisted treatment , considered the gold standard in addressing opioid addiction ;  953 : the number of prisoners who have agreed to serve as peer navigators to help other addicts negotiate treatment and recovery behind bars ; nearly half have been trained by experts at rutgers university .

averting a sentiment reversal or breather before the dive  following monday \\'s broad tumble in risk-leaning assets , it grew difficult to ignore the threat that sentiment could be systemically shaken from its useful complacency . with a host of benchmarks on the \\' risk on \\' side of the spectrum posting notable -- albeit short-term -- technical breakdowns , the ranks were on high alert for signs of follow through deleveraging . beyond the simple high levels of favorite milestones like top global equity indices , there are various measures for exposure which paint a troubling picture for a market that comes under any severe stress . below is the nyse \\'s brokerage leverage between credit and debit balances           , recognition of risk alone is not enough to pitch the market into a tailspin . the question is when this tipping point is met which in turn leads many to obsess ( myself included ) of the \\' how \\' it will be prompted .  chart of s&amp;p 500 and nyse broker-level \\' leverage \\' ( monthly )  chart made by john kicklighter with data from bloomberg platform  if your preference is not to lead with fundamentals and evaluating the difficult-to-register priorities of a crowd , there are technical milestones that are important as well . the correlation , direction and pace of risk-sensitive assets is my preferred measure of speculative conviction . that said , there are certain individual benchmarks that can offer interesting insight on a more timely basis . the s&amp;p 500 for example is perhaps one of the most frequently referenced and heavily traded ( through derivatives ) such market leader , but its interaction with the prominent channel of the past three months leaves open greater interpretation . that is n\\'t so for the dow ( and nasdaq ) . this           new resistance . looking to some of the other risk measures i like to follow , their ability to close their bearish gaps to start the week was far less remarkable , leaving broader conviction more likely more attuned to concern .  what are the top fundamental themes to watch ahead ?  with the question of the bearing in global sentiment as seemingly contentious as it has been in three months , the natural next step is to start looking for the practical catalysts that can tip the scales one way or the other . yet , before you consider what will dominant the headlines , consider the underlying bias of the markets . i \\'ve highlighted many times before that there have been periods where good news has gone unnoticed by the market while the bad triggers an avalanche of fear , and visa versa . that is the inherent bias that can shape the influence of not just event risk , but broader fundamental themes as well . against this backdrop , it is also worth noting that certain themes can also hold greater potential through           poll i conducted in twitter asking traders what they thought the most important theme would be over the next session . a thin margin voted the coronavirus headlines . this is not a theme that can really charge optimism and even relief could be difficult to muster given the nature of the situation . consider that should the headlines and relative china market performance metrics ( dow to fxi rather than usdcnh ) start to command headlines .  poll from johnkicklighter handle in twitter.com  a marginal difference to the second place most market-moving threat find the fomc decision due wednesday afternoon in washington dc stirring considerable interest . from a risk perspective , this particular topic has prompted much more speculative relief and risk build up based in complacency speculative reach over the past years . monetary policy \\'s general effectiveness is a latent concern among some ( myself a big proponent of this monitoring ) , but that is the exception to the rule . most still see central banks as ready-serving backstops to any disruption in the market . that makes it more prone to spur           probability of change at this meeting is low , but the market is pricing in anticipation throughout 2020 . in fact , there is chance of both cuts and hikes looking ahead .  growth interests will be waiting to take the reins after the fed passes  while the focus will be on the fed when it comes to the broad and targeted influence of monetary policy , it is worth mentioning the bank of england ( boe ) is on deck for its own policy assessment on thursday . this is particularly important for the sterling and gbpusd in particular , though it may not rise to the occasion of a global sentiment catalyst . the interest is based in the contentious 50 percent probability of a rate cut at the gathering according to swaps . that means that at least half of the market will be surprised one way or the other . that degree of volatility potential will give pause to any traders tempted to take significant exposure with that uncertainty just around the corner .  chart of gbpusd with 200-day moving average  chart           gain greater traction as the week wears on is the health of the global economy . the most prominent listings are the us and euro-area 4q gdp updates due thursday and friday respectively . however , there is other data that will draw attention to the general theme -- and recession fears if the data prints poorly -- in the interim session . this past session offered up a mixed view form the world \\'s largest economy with a us consumer confidence vaulting to 131.6 ( from 128.2 ) for the conference board \\'s january update but non-defense durable goods orders excluding transportation ( one of the more popular proxies for gdp ) dropped unexpectedly by -0.9 percent . the us 10-year to 2-year yield curve bounced alongside risk trends , but the pressure is still clearly present . for wednesday , earnings will take center stage . apple reported robust earnings after hours tuesday night . for the
